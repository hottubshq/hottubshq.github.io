<p>With the popularity of hot tubs as household items, more and more people are going to hot tub dealers to purchase one for their own use. We are offering Jacuzzi Whirlpool Bathtubto our client and our product is made of good quality. Another primary reason many homeowners are now opting for indoor hot tubs rather than outside is the weather. These X-Series models stand out from typical jetted options because the four swim jets are air-free and produce a no-turbulence current. Quality spa heaters are always placed within a marine grade stainless steel tube.</p>
<p>This spinning wheel has indentations that move water through the pump and create the pressure in the pipes needed to keep water circulating and moving through the spa plumbing. Swim spas have one amazing addition that traditional swimming pools lack—the hydrotherapeutic experience. You can program a customized swimming experience to suit individual preferences, monitor your progress, and swim whenever you like in the comfort of your own home.</p>
<p>All of a sudden, you could produce a 14′ to 18′ long Swim Spa and offer it for sale anywhere between $13,000 - $25,000 complete, delivered, hooked up and installed and ready for use in a few hours. Modern tubs also usually include hydrotherapy jets, making it possible to have a nice relaxing massage while soaking in the hot tub. They are a combination of swimming pools and tubs. Also check out our JACUZZI® financing options so you can rest easy in your tub without worrying about your bank account.</p>

<p>The Indulgence swim spa is the top of the line for us at Sunbelt Spas. Although ABS based acrylic has proven strength, fibreglass is still sometimes added in order to ensure it maintains its strength alongside supporting the spas water and bather load.

The next big leap forward came when the Jacuzzi brothers hydrotherapy pump was combined with fibreglass bodywork, a filtration system and electric heating system to create what is essentially the modern day hot tub.</p>

<p>A soak in the hot tub is also helpful for stimulating healthy blood flow and stress relief. Sitting in a hot tub spa with the water temperature no higher than 104 degrees helps relax your body.
