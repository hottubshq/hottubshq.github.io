<p>Family owned Sacramento dealer offering affordable high quality Turbo Spas and Swim Spas. You are probably thinking, Yeah, this sounds great, but it probably costs like a trillion dollars.” That is a common misconception about Swim Spas…that they are only for the fabulously wealthy. Illumatherapy also offers four points of entry, with two on each side of the tub, and air bubbles spraying from the jets give the appearance of dancing as they reflect the light. The blowers make the hot tub feel like you've got your own personal geyser - forcing air from the bottom of the pool, and creating a very relaxing environment for you.</p>
<p>Look for swim spas that are insulated to keep in the heat and pumps and motors that are rated more energy efficient. When you get the hot tubs, the first thing you need to do it to read the installation manual very carefully. Obviously spa pools are wet areas. The self-cleaning swim spas clean 100% of the water in the unit in just 45 minutes, so you can spend more time enjoying your swim spa. An indoor hot tub generally can be found in a bathroom and is made of fiberglass.</p>
<p>A pool spa is used for people who have plenty of room in their yard and who want the best of both worlds for their swimming and relaxation pleasure. If you don't have kids or plan to only use your spa for swimming and exercise, a one tank spa might work out better. All Vortex Swim Spas are big enough for inflatable toys right up to a floating lounger. This company has five lines of swim spas: AquaPlay, AquaTrainer, ExecutiveTrainer, AquaSport and ExecutiveSport.</p>

Available in a range of specifications and sizes, all HydroPool swim spas come equipped with their own heating, filtration, underwater lighting and water purification systems.</p>
<p>Smaller 2 person spas normally need more frequent water changes than larger 8 person spas (except if 8 people are using the spa more than twice a week!). A primary reason people buy swim spas is to swim laps without needing a big pool. As larger units were designed to accommodate more people, Jacuzzi® incorporated heating and filtration systems to keep the water warm and clean, thus creating the first hot tub in 1970.</p>
<h3>What Does A Swim Spa Cost Clemson</h3>
<p>This wood-fired hot tub is light, easy to handle, to move around and also only takes a 5th of the heating time of conventional hot tubs. Swim spas are only unhealthy if you don't look after them properly. There are so many benefits to owning a swim spa and by following the above seven tips you can be sure to find the best swim spa for your family and needs. One major thing to remember and definitely not overlook is how much space you have to fit your hot tub into.</p>
<p>Water remains calm in a swimming pool, which can encourage walking or standing over a more active swimming experience. Just outside the back door, you can have an amazing temperature controlled pool and hot tub in one - the perfect space for light aquatic exercise followed by rejuvenation and allover relaxation. If the hot water jets are on, sit on the opposite side where the water temperature is slightly lower.</p>
<p>Outdoor hot tubs also come in a variety of styles but are generally either a round or octagon shape. Most of these accidents happened at a pool or hot tub at the child's own home.

<p>Compared to a pool, the ratio of people to volume of water is drastically different to in a spa, prompting unexpected spikes in pH. A jump in pH can cause the water to become alkaline and cloudy, leading to scale build up in your spa. In addition, swimming can be great for runners recovering from injuries since it not only helps maintain good physical health but also improves mental health. The insulation around the cabinet traps in waste heat created by the pumps and heater, greatly increasing the energy efficiency of the swim spa as a whole.</p>
