<p>Hot Tubs from the east usually have every accessory but not the one they really need a Skip!. Built with strong and durable materials, Jacuzzi spas will operate at a consistently high level, assuring you reliable, energy-efficient performance for years of worry-free hot tub enjoyment.

<p>So these many jets (not that many really) simply do not have enough power to actually make these Jets perform properly, So for performance in a Hot Tub it is just not a simple question of the number of Jets but it does come down to things like engineering and design and the balance of the Jets with the correct motors and water pumps to produce the better all round product More often than not, these Hot Tubs with lower rated motors have to have a diverter valve fitted so that other parts of the spa can be turned off to get any decent power where one is actually sitting.</p>
