<p>A hot tub is a large home made or manufactured tub filled with hot water. We are offering Waterfall Jacuzzito our client and our product is made of good quality. These swim spas are usually made in North America (making parts easier and cheaper to source) and come with a more robust warranty. Making this a great time to buy a hot tub. Hydrotherapy from home spas allows unique health benefits. The 5.5 Series Aqua Swim is a plunge pool, never ending swimming pool, hydrotherapy spa and aqua-aerobics centre all in one.</p>
<p>It is important to note, though, that the overall size of a swim spa is different from the amount of usable swimming space it contains. Most swim spas found in Canada fall into the mid-range category; costing between $20,000-$35,000. Your swim spa will be the perfect outlet for relaxation, leisure, fun with family. The temperature in an unheated walk-in tub drops to 98.6 in 10 minutes, requiring the bather to add more hot water to remain comfortable.</p>
<p>If you are planning to heat your swim spa for some or all of the year the best way to do this is with a heat pump which can heat (and potentially cool) your spa - providing total control over the water temperature for under $10 a week. It's important to note that some insurance providers simply won't cover you with the additional risk that a hot tub introduces. We recommend that you consult a plumber to calculate precisely what size water heater you'll need for a walk-in tub so you won't shortchange the rest of your household while bathing.</p>
