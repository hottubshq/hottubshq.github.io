<p>When you install your hot tub on the deck and start to enjoy it, it is then you realize that you need to have a gazebo or an enclosure to give you privacy from prying eye when you are inside. Note: Our swim spas are fully plumbed and mechanically assembled, ready for use other than a couple of final connections at the site. But one exercise that never goes out of style is swimming. Swimming is exercise, and with any exercise we are losing moisture from the body - and it is important to replenish this moisture. Clearwater Spas warrants the operating equipment and plumbing against defects in workmanship for five years from the original purchase date.</p>
<p>However, there are also disadvantages with such a design because the heat of the sun will be bearing down on you during the day and there is the increased possibility of dirt and debris blowing into the water of the tub. Some Sapphire spas have seats full of jets that we've positioned to target problem areas of the back, neck, and shoulders. They offer a powerful and steady current by using the paddle-wheel devices, jet propulsion, and water that has the speed of 2 and up to 8.5 mph.</p>
