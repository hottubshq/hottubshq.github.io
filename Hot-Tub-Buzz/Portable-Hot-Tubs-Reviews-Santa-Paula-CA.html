<p>Hot tubs and spas are becoming increasingly more popular and they are to be found in many homes. According to Wikipedia : a Hot Tub is a large tub or small pool full of heated water and used for hydrotherapy or pleasure. Add warmth and water movement and hot tubbing becomes the stuff of lifetime memories. If you do use a hot tub, turn down the temperature and limit your time in the water to less than 10 minutes. A Spa system will use air to push the water around your bath and create that bubble and whirl effects.</p>
<p>The 150mm swim jets create a current strong enough to swim against. If you want a little more versatility from your hot tub then swim spas are also a popular choice for gardens. Hot tubs are also designed for more than one person, so soaking can be a great opportunity to spend some time with your partner or friends. Vortex Swim Spas are the perfect centre point of any party. The most common type of tub is the Jacuzzi drop in tub For installation, these tubs are simply lowered into a framed enclosure, and they also include Jacuzzi's largest variety of available sizes and shapes.</p>

<p>When shopping for coverage, be sure that you mention the hot tub to make sure a provider will cover a property with a hot tub. For all swimming pools, insert removable skimmer baskets to catch large debris before entering into the filtration system. When this is done it takes forever for the tub to warm up due to very little amount of power flowing through the heating elements, I do not recommend this way of installation for the large units.</p>
<p>Swimming in a swim spa adds extra benefits. That is why if you notice, the jets are usually positioned at the most stressed muscles of the body - the calves, neck, some at the back, and at the sole of the feet. We favored those that sell spas with paddlewheel current systems, since they're usually the strongest. The bath water is recirculated through the jets, which keeps the water a bit warmer than air being forced in the bath.</p>

<p>If you are planning to heat your swim spa for some or all of the year the best way to do this is with a heat pump which can heat (and potentially cool) your spa - providing total control over the water temperature for under $10 a week. It's important to note that some insurance providers simply won't cover you with the additional risk that a hot tub introduces. We recommend that you consult a plumber to calculate precisely what size water heater you'll need for a walk-in tub so you won't shortchange the rest of your household while bathing.</p>
