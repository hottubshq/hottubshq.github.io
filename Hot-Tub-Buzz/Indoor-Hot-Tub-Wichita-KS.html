The ingenuity behind the Endless Pools Swim Machine is just the beginning of the many benefits of owning an Endless Pools Fitness Systems. This is not the case if the spa has a Spa Net” brand controller (fully heat pump compatible). Most people are not duly trained in installing whirlpool tubs so it is strongly advised to hire a contractor for installation.</p>
<p>Hot tub covers should always be on the Jacuzzi when not in use, keeping excess dirt and dust out of the water and jets, keep wandering children out of the water (many are lockable) and reducing heat loss to keep your bills as low as possible.

<p>Raised push buttons also make operating the light, air, and whirlpool systems extremely easy. In the late 1960s, Roy Jacuzzi, a third-generation Jacuzzi toyed with the idea of marketing the pump-fitted bath tub dubbed the 'Roman Bathtub' to cater for the growing need for leisure. When Swim Spas first came on the market about 10 years ago, they were priced in the $25,000 range. By having a smaller tub the volume of water is a lot less therefore running cost are reduced due to the heater having less water to heat.</p>
