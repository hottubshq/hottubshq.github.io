<p>That wonderful feeling you get whenever you sit back in a hot tub is because of the way your body reacts to the heat and jets of water. Jacuzzi® is the name that defines the hot tub experience. Our product range includes Steam Bath Unit, Sauna Bath Unit, Shower Enclosure, Bath Tubs, Jacuzzi Systems, Spa Product, Bathroom Accessories and similar other products. The spa tubs have a purification system attached to it. This system ensures that the water that enters the tub is cleaned of all contaminants. You want to be in your tub, not taking a bunch of time to maintain it. That's why Rich's has carried Leisure Time, the premier name in hot tub water care for over twenty-five years.</p>
<p>These same rules apply at residential spas, hot tubs and pools, too. Hot tub folliculitis is a type of skin infection on the hair follicles which is brought about by immersion in a hot tub with unclean water. If you break out in itchy spots after using a hot tub, you may have "hot tub rash." It's one of the more common illnesses linked to hot tubs , according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).</p>
<p>A spa or hot tub should be shocked with the appropriate sanitizer after use. Hot tub water chemicals, especially chlorine have a specific formula that lasts in hot water won't turn the water cloudy and has the right pH for hot tubbing. When spas are created with less than 4 layers it will be made evident through the shorter warranties that accompany the spa pool as its lifespan will be dramatically shortened.</p>

<h3>Swimming For Fitness Kennebunk</h3>
<p>A soak in the hot tub is also helpful for stimulating healthy blood flow and stress relief. Sitting in a hot tub spa with the water temperature no higher than 104 degrees helps relax your body. Most cases are tied to indoor hot tubs, where there is less ventilation. An advantage of swim spas over a traditional swimming pool is its ability to be used year round. There's hot tubs… and then there's Hot Spring At the front of the pack in the hot tub industry, Hot Spring offers a wide range of different models and options and can accommodate anywhere from three to seven people.</p>
<p>2. 24 hour circulation pumps-These pumps function by using a small pump to force water through the heating and filtration system. The ingenuity behind the Endless Pools Swim Machine is just the beginning of the many benefits of owning an Endless Pools Fitness Systems. This is not the case if the spa has a Spa Net” brand controller (fully heat pump compatible). Most people are not duly trained in installing whirlpool tubs so it is strongly advised to hire a contractor for installation.</p>
<p>The benefits of swimming are well known. Next is Spa Pack to hot tub. Swim spas do enable you to enjoy swimming and hydrotherapy in even a relatively small backyard. Design, Wellbeing, Performance and Care: these are the values that constituted the essence of Jacuzzi®, a brand that anticipates needs and trends, creating innovative products and solutions designed to meet requests of any kind. The best way to find a genuine and reliable hot tub dealer is to see if they are part of BISHTA (British and Irish Spa and Hot Tub Association), this is a hot tub association that makes sure all hot tub dealers are keeping to the correct laws and make sure they are providing customers with safe information as well as good service to their customers.</p>

If you plan to heat your swim spa regularly, especially the swim end due to the large amount of water, you need to be able to use a gas or a heat pump as the electric heaters will be very expensive.</p>
