<p>OK, class ~ it's time to define the true meaning of the different types of hot water therapy. It has the new River Jet swim system with Viper pumps, and plenty of water features. Whisper-quiet motors, colorful lighting, dancing air bubbles, powerful jets — your bath is an expression of yourself and an extension of how you want to feel. Most indoor kinds hold one or two people simply because the available space is limited to the standard size bathroom. Similar to a regular bathtub you would see in a home, these hot tubs, sometimes called whirlpool baths or Jacuzzis, are filled with water for each use than drained when your soaking is complete.</p>
<p>This is also how hot tubs take away stress. Hot tubs are unlike saunas, steam- and Turkish baths, which are steam only. You can easily assemble a swim spa together and use it as a portable swimming pool, wherever you go. Positioned to hit your shoulders and torso (jets that are too far apart or too low will not create the required resistance against the body and are a waste of water flow). Spas should also have a diverter valve to maintain water pressure on 1 or 2 seats.</p>
<p>The major ways are sexual intercourse, wiping from back to front after urinating, and sometimes from soaking in warm water. Vortex Spas are plumbed using Duraflex flexible PVC plumbing, which is specially designed for use in high performance swim spas. A swim spa is fundamentally a smaller version of a pool and can come in different sizes according to what you want. There have been deaths due to drowning in hot tubs attributed to alcohol use.</p>

While technically Jacuzzi is a proper and brand name, when people use the word jacuzzi, they are referring to a standard hot tub.</p>
