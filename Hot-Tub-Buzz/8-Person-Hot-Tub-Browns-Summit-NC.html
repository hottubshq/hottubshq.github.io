<p>There are various kinds of spas you can indulge in as per your requirements and convenience. The HL 630 Healthy Living model is one of the best-selling spas in the Healthy Living series. This acrylic hot tub is probably the closest thing you'll get to a real Jacuzzi in your garden. It caters for all of your relaxation, exercise & entertainment needs in one luxury swim spa. Think about the rules posted at public pools, including no running or diving, showering before and after swimming, and no peeing in the water.</p>
<p>The most prominent safety feature walk-in tubs bring to the table — the door — also has a downside because you can't fill the tub with water before entering it, which could leave you a bit chilled. Hot tubs offer rest and relaxation. Swim spas are perfect for anyone who is looking for a healthy, low-impact way to exercise on a daily basis. And just like its namesake, great performance is exactly what you'll experience with the Michael Phelps Legend Series hot tub.</p>
<p>You can use a smartphone app to run your swim spa from afar, opt for a speaker system and even a fancy cover to protect your investment. Hot tubs are also found at natural hot springs ; in this case, the water may be dangerously hot and must be combined with cool water for a safe soaking temperature. These days, Jacuzzi employs nearly 5,000 people worldwide and has become the name we most associate with whirlpool baths.</p>

<h3>Hot Tub House Browns Summit NC 27214</h3>
<p>The whirlpool bath was invented in the early 1940s by Candidi Jacuzzi, a second generation Jacuzzi. It's like a hot tub - but with even more benefits. Lay-Z-Spa makes a third entry onto our list with the Monaco hot tub. These little creatures can rapidly grow their colonies, especially in hot tubs that are not well maintained, and those that do not have periodic cleaning of the water. At Master Spas, we make buying a swim spa just as relaxing as owning one.</p>
<p>Swim Spas are smaller than typical swimming pools and this makes them much easier to drain for cleaning and maintenance. Between 2000 and 2014, outbreaks from treated pools and hot tubs were linked to more than 27,000 infections and eight deaths in the United States. They are often installed in houses as a replacement for a regular bathtub. Producing a steady, smooth current, single-shell models from Endless Pool Fitness Systems are perfect for those who enjoy total-body aquatic activity and complete relaxation.</p>
<p>Smaller 2 person spas normally need more frequent water changes than larger 8 person spas (except if 8 people are using the spa more than twice a week!). A primary reason people buy swim spas is to swim laps without needing a big pool. As larger units were designed to accommodate more people, Jacuzzi® incorporated heating and filtration systems to keep the water warm and clean, thus creating the first hot tub in 1970.</p>
<p>A choice that combines Jacuzzi® reliability, quality and value. Spa filters help to remove impurities from the water and ensure your spa pool water is safe for you, your family and friends. In addition, swimming against swim jets is a very different experience to swimming against a natural water current. So if your swim spa's shell structure fails anytime within the 10 year warranty, we replace it. No questions asked.</p>
