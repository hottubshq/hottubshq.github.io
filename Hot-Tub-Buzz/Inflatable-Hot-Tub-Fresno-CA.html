<p>The reason most people opt for a swim spa is that they don't have enough room for a full-sized swimming pool. The swimming part of a swim spa is what makes it uniquely different than a hot tub alone, however. Always make certain the spa's control system accommodates the heat pump. And if you're interested in swimming laps without installing a massive pool, swim spas are a great alternative.
