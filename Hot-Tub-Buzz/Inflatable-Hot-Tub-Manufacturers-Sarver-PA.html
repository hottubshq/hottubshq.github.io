Only the Swim Spa WaterWatch® tracks distance and monitors performance, heart rate, calories and more while offering real time results and feedback. With a Coast Spas Wellness Spa® you'll sleep and feel better, increase your fitness and stamina, elevate your mood as well as lower your blood pressure. From time to time it may become necessary to update or change our Privacy Statement and ThermoSpas encourages you to periodically check here for the most current version.</p>

<p>Since a whirl pool is a place where people spend a considerable amount of time inside, it should have good wide panoramic views so as to avoid monotony and boredom. Swim spas offer all the comfort and benefits of hot tubs, but they come in a larger size, almost like a small swimming pool. Start by thinking about how you plan to use the swim spa — therapy, relaxation, exercise or all of the above. The Jacuzzi water heater model is the king of them all.</p>
