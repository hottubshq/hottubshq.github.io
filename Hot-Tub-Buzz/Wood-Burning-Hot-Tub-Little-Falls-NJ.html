<p>Hydrotherapy and Jacuzzi hot tubs seem to go hand and hand these days. The Endless Pools Fitness Systems shell has a modern style with clean lines that flow gracefully from end to end. Built from the highest quality acrylic, Endless Pools swim spas are designed to provide years of family fun and enjoyment. The Jacuzzi brother's patent ran out 10 years later in 1976 which lead to the American hot tub market taking off as they were able to use the Jacuzzi type jets. The original hydrotherapy jet was invented by the Jacuzzi® brothers in 1956.</p>
<p>The water hot temperature, the massage made by swiveling water jets and the ergonomic shape of the hot tub bring down the body tension and soothe your muscles. Swim spas with paddlewheels are the most expensive design and usually cost $35,000 or more, but offer an excellent current to swim against. Swim spas are moderately-sized jetted tubs. We are offering Whirlpool Bathtubto our client and our product is made of good quality.</p>
<p>With some minor reconstruction of the bathroom design, even older homes can take advantage of this concept bathtub to open up the room and give a more meditative soak. Infrared home saunas, however, create a sauna environment within a wooden box or even an open space while the heaters create the actual heating effect. With the current's five speeds, the whole family can meet their wellness goals with rowing, resistance exercise, swimming, and relaxing hydrotherapy.</p>
