<p>Even though swim spas are hugely beneficial from a health and wellness perspective, they suffer from one major drawback. Swim spas are not an ideal choice for families, as only one person can comfortably swim in a swim spa at any time. The Jacuzzi brand tradition of innovation in hydro-massage has made Jacuzzi the most desired product in whirlpool bathing. Our spas come with valuable customer and technical support for the lifetime of the spa. Visit Jacuzzi Hot Tubs and Outdoor Living to discover all the ways you can benefit from the high standards and the low maintenance offered by a HydroPool.</p>
<p>The drastic price difference while having the same benefits give swim spas an advantage over the other options. There are Hot tub on the marketplace now that are designed for two people only; therefore the tubs are much smaller to the traditional larger hot tubs. These smaller sized swim spas can still accommodate several bathers, although if you're taller than average it might feel a little small. Another great characteristic that comes with owning a swim spa is that its maintenance is so much easier then it would be with owning a swimming pool.</p>
<p>You can purchase the Jacuzzi Luxura Bath Tub that will cost you about $559.00. This is the perfect bath tub for a consumer that may be on a tighter budget.

For all swim spas, be sure to maintain a chlorine level of about 1.0 - 2.0 ppm or if using bromine, 2.0 - 4.0 ppm. Meanwhile, the permanent hydrotherapy pools in the spas became known as spas or spa pools themselves just to make life a little more complicated.</p>

<p>Given its background, the options that Jacuzzi offers elevates bathing from a cleaning session to a bathing experience you'd find in a spa. Relax with massaging spa jets in the perfect water temperature, year-round. The self-cleaning option helps keep the jets and the tubing that runs throughout the Jacuzzi bathtub clean. The you must consider also that where a hot tub is subject to regular use it will accumulate natural body oils, perspiration, and other material that may mark the water line.</p>
<p>The difference with swim spas is that they're often larger than a standard spa pool and have an open area at one end without seating.
