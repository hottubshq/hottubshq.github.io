<p>Jacuzzis are among the most popular addition to a luxury bathroom. The choice ranges from more classic wood-covered hot tubs, for a timeless elegance, to the most glamorous ones with faux leather covering, conceived to resist bed weather. There are hot tubs suitable for very small spaces and even unusual geometric designs. Swim spas, on the other hand, offer you the two options that you can choose from to suit the weather. Some of the features to look for in a swimspa that can provide this type of an experience are fitness related.</p>
<p>Exercise in general will increase the amount of air taken into the lungs, but swimming in particular can make a big impact. I would recommend Spa World (especially their swim spa range) to anyone that is weighing between a spa and a pool. With three airless jets, comfortable seating for the whole family, 27 hydromassage jets, and generous recreation space, harmony between work and play is possible. All Jacuzzi® brand bathtubs are made from the highest quality acrylic.</p>
<p>If you are planning to heat your swim spa for some or all of the year the best way to do this is with a heat pump which can heat (and potentially cool) your spa - providing total control over the water temperature for under $10 a week. It's important to note that some insurance providers simply won't cover you with the additional risk that a hot tub introduces. We recommend that you consult a plumber to calculate precisely what size water heater you'll need for a walk-in tub so you won't shortchange the rest of your household while bathing.</p>

<p>Your swim spa should be heat pump ready” and you should try and buy a swim spa with a heat pump compatible controller. In a Swim Spa, you are swimming in place as water rushes past you causing a loss of buoyancy that would be normally produced as you pull yourself up and over static water with every stroke. This then pairs with a bigger pump which is in charge of fueling the spas jets. They then managed to create a swimming spa which is more convenient to use compared to outdoor activities.</p>
