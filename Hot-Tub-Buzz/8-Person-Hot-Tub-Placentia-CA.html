<p>Interior design is about creating a harmonious space to live in, about creating exciting and functional environments in your home. Sure, if your bathroom is too small for a hot tub, or any tub for that matter, you could always choose a massage shower.

Also, pull up or remove ladders from above-ground models when not in use to prevent children from climbing into the pool or hot tub. An H2X Fitness Swim Spa allows you to exercise, relax, and entertain in the convenience and privacy of your backyard, year-round.</p>
