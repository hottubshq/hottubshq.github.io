<p>If you are unfamiliar with a swim spa, then just the title is enough to make you wonder what it is and how it can benefit you. First this is something that can help you solve a lot of the problems of the day as you take the time to relax in your hot tub at home after a long days drive, or a long day at the office. The portion in which you can swim laps are what makes a swim spa uniquely different from a hot tub alone. For more intensive swimming pool cleaning services, purchase a small, portable pump to remove standing water from the cover.</p>
<p>With the burgeoning interest in health and leisure across the United States, yet another opportunity was spotted in the 1960s, by Roy Jacuzzi, who invented and marketed the first self-contained, fully-integrated whirlpool bath, creating a whole new industry almost on his own. In short, hot tubs and Jacuzzis are not the same. Tests have proven that through having a heat pump within your spa pool or swim spa, running costs are reduced by over 50%, resulting in shortened and achievable payback period.</p>
<p>Also, our Jacuzzi bathtub is designed using topmost grade material and progressive technology in conformity with latest market trends. Due to the hot, damp environment that occurs around a swim spa, even the hardiest of timbers will be susceptible to mold and mildew. You do not drain the water from a hot tub after each use. Jacuzzi tub brings the health benifits too. Swim spas provide space for kids to move around. Adding to Jacuzzi's fabulous range of therapy tubs and installation types are its innovative technologies.</p>

Wooden hot tubs are still used in some spas and resorts, for the special touch they enhance the interior design with a certain "je ne sai quois" reminding us of long-forgotten times when there were no modern bathrooms and people had to bath in wooden tubs.</p>
<p>Not only is this warm air recycled and used to warm the water in your jets, but it also helps to maintain the water temperature and thus saves energy and indeed the user money as it will help to reduce the electricity used. You can get a spa package before planning out your vacation or just book yourself when you check in. It is advisable to call ahead and make bookings, as sometimes hotel spas run full.
