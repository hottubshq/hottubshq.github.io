<p>If you are looking to have a swimming pool and hot tub combination, a two tank swim spa might be your best option. Swim spas require a solid, level surface to sit on and an electrical supply line (usually 220 volt, similar to a hot tub). We believe the best way to deliver great service is to represent the number 1 hot tub brand in the world - Jacuzzi. In fact, some studies suggest aquatic exercise may be more effective than on-land workouts for some people with back ailments, according to an article by Rena Goldman in Pool & Spa News Like with osteoarthritis and bone and joints ailments, the secret here lies in the reduction of pressure on your joints provided by the buoyancy of the water.</p>

Also, hot tubs are pretty easy to maintain, which is what you need if it is going to be something you want to relax in. Especially if you consider it against getting something like a swimming pool which is going to take up a lot of space and be high maintenance.</p>
<p>Hot water is a great way to keep the body moving. A Jacuzzi soaking tub is the most common type of tub, and this basic concept is Jacuzzi's foundation for hydrotherapy tubs. Some hot tubs also come with features that Jacuzzi products do not, such as flat-screen TVs and built-in MP3 audio systems. Our Swim Spa River Jets are each powered solely by a 4 HP (6BHP) Hyper Flow Jet Pump. Having the swim spa completely above ground is another option that allows you to fence only the steps (as long as the swim spa is over 1200mm high the height of pool fencing).</p>
