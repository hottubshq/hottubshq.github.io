A Jacuzzi soaking tub is the most common type of tub, and this basic concept is Jacuzzi's foundation for hydrotherapy tubs. Some hot tubs also come with features that Jacuzzi products do not, such as flat-screen TVs and built-in MP3 audio systems. Our Swim Spa River Jets are each powered solely by a 4 HP (6BHP) Hyper Flow Jet Pump. Having the swim spa completely above ground is another option that allows you to fence only the steps (as long as the swim spa is over 1200mm high the height of pool fencing).</p>
<p>The 150mm swim jets create a current strong enough to swim against. If you want a little more versatility from your hot tub then swim spas are also a popular choice for gardens. Hot tubs are also designed for more than one person, so soaking can be a great opportunity to spend some time with your partner or friends. Vortex Swim Spas are the perfect centre point of any party.
