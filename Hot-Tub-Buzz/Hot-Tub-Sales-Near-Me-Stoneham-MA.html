<p>Hot tubs serve their purpose well in reducing stress and muscle tension from our body-from an adult body used to extreme temperatures. This state-of-the-art spa is designed in accordance to European standards and gives a smooth swimming experience. We are one of the trusted names engaged in designing SPA Pools that are appreciated for their comfortable sitting, powerful jets and easy to use controls.

<p>The benefits of swimming are well known. Next is Spa Pack to hot tub. Swim spas do enable you to enjoy swimming and hydrotherapy in even a relatively small backyard. Design, Wellbeing, Performance and Care: these are the values that constituted the essence of Jacuzzi®, a brand that anticipates needs and trends, creating innovative products and solutions designed to meet requests of any kind. The best way to find a genuine and reliable hot tub dealer is to see if they are part of BISHTA (British and Irish Spa and Hot Tub Association), this is a hot tub association that makes sure all hot tub dealers are keeping to the correct laws and make sure they are providing customers with safe information as well as good service to their customers.</p>
<p>If you are looking to have a swimming pool and hot tub combination, a two tank swim spa might be your best option. Swim spas require a solid, level surface to sit on and an electrical supply line (usually 220 volt, similar to a hot tub). We believe the best way to deliver great service is to represent the number 1 hot tub brand in the world - Jacuzzi. In fact, some studies suggest aquatic exercise may be more effective than on-land workouts for some people with back ailments, according to an article by Rena Goldman in Pool & Spa News Like with osteoarthritis and bone and joints ailments, the secret here lies in the reduction of pressure on your joints provided by the buoyancy of the water.</p>

A bathroom size of 2.8 m by 2.8 m is sufficient enough to fit in a Jacuzzi and leave enough space around it.</p>
<p>Swimming in a swim spa adds extra benefits. That is why if you notice, the jets are usually positioned at the most stressed muscles of the body - the calves, neck, some at the back, and at the sole of the feet. We favored those that sell spas with paddlewheel current systems, since they're usually the strongest. The bath water is recirculated through the jets, which keeps the water a bit warmer than air being forced in the bath.</p>
