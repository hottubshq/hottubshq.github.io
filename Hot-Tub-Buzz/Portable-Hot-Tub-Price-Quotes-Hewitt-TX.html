<p>Some cheap Hot Tubs which are usually cheap imports from the East claim to have many Jets but many times there are just simple pin point Jets, which do not rotate, or cross fire and are un-adjustable and in my view not really worth having but can look very enticing to a prospective purchaser.

If, when you go to see it and it is empty of water or is disconnected from the electricity then you should obviously arrange for another visit or wait for it to be reconnected and filled up with water, and turned on.</p>

The blowers make the hot tub feel like you've got your own personal geyser - forcing air from the bottom of the pool, and creating a very relaxing environment for you.</p>
