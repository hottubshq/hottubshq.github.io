<p>Saunas have existed for thousands of years and are now being rediscovered the world over for their health and social benefits. The ancient Greeks and the Romans also all had a great love for communal hot baths fed by natural hot springs and many of these bath houses had massage facilities, sports arenas and places to eat included as well. This GFCI protection panel (Spa Pack) is to be not closer than 5 feet from the hot tub, yet within site of the unit no gates or walls (NEC 680.24 -B2b).

<p>When you put Jacuzzi® Pro Grade Pool Equipment in your backyard, you trust its performance. Jacuzzi Pure Air tubs range from a bubbly champagne-like experience to a steadier stream of bubbles, depending entirely on the setting chosen by the user. Typically swim spas are generally about 12 to 24 feet in length. Taking a bath in the Spa Jacuzzi bathtub is a great way to enjoy and release stress after a long day at work.</p>
<p>The warm water inside the tub can relax spasms, alleviate sprains, backache, and fatigue. This allow you to run your heat pump from your spa controller (not via a separate touchpad), use both heat pump AND electric heater for extra fast heating and extends the life of the heat pump. The heat eases out the tension built up in the muscles and increases the blood flow, which in turn heals the body. With 60 years of experience in manufacturing and a legacy of quality products, you can trust that Jacuzzi® understands quality and is focused on customer satisfaction.</p>
