<p>A lot of people ask what is the difference between a swim spa and a swimming pool? When you install your hot tub or pool you may or may not have used conduit or a duct that is buried in your garden for protecting the cables, if there is spare capacity, you can feed your power and cable leads through the duct to the location normally on a wall near the pool or hot tub. While some spas still use wooden tubs, there are many private spas that use specially designed hot tubs and whirlpools to create a relaxing atmosphere for their clients while still using the healing power of warm water.</p>
<p>Jacuzzi® Brand Hot Tubs are well known for their performance, innovation, and reliability. Most swim spas come as plug and play” designs.

<p>By choosing a swim spa, you can swim without doing laps in a regular sized pool. Hot tubs can replace what used to happen nightly at the dinner table. The benefits of using jetted bathtubs should never be underestimated. Swim spas would waste a single penny of yours. Swim spas tend to have large seating areas, as they are primarily used for relaxation rather than swimming. This has added jets that release high pressure water, making you feel like you are swimming against the current.</p>

<p>The quality of the fiberglass and the manufacturing process used is also something that you should inquire about when buying a hot tub or swim spa The tubs with the best understructure are those in which each layer of fiberglass is applied by hand to the shell. How does Jacuzzi redefine the very word "luxury?" With the Jacuzzi Bellavista collection of luxury tubs. At Amazon Hot Tubs, we believe in no hassle, no haggle, full price transparency.</p>
<p>A soak in the hot tub is also helpful for stimulating healthy blood flow and stress relief. Sitting in a hot tub spa with the water temperature no higher than 104 degrees helps relax your body. Most cases are tied to indoor hot tubs, where there is less ventilation. An advantage of swim spas over a traditional swimming pool is its ability to be used year round.
