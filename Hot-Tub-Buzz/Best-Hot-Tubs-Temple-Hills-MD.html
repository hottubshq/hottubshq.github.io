<p>That wonderful feeling you get whenever you sit back in a hot tub is because of the way your body reacts to the heat and jets of water. Jacuzzi® is the name that defines the hot tub experience. Our product range includes Steam Bath Unit, Sauna Bath Unit, Shower Enclosure, Bath Tubs, Jacuzzi Systems, Spa Product, Bathroom Accessories and similar other products. The spa tubs have a purification system attached to it. This system ensures that the water that enters the tub is cleaned of all contaminants. You want to be in your tub, not taking a bunch of time to maintain it. That's why Rich's has carried Leisure Time, the premier name in hot tub water care for over twenty-five years.</p>
<p>The most prominent safety feature walk-in tubs bring to the table — the door — also has a downside because you can't fill the tub with water before entering it, which could leave you a bit chilled. Hot tubs offer rest and relaxation. Swim spas are perfect for anyone who is looking for a healthy, low-impact way to exercise on a daily basis. And just like its namesake, great performance is exactly what you'll experience with the Michael Phelps Legend Series hot tub.</p>

A pump with a higher horsepower is going to cost you more - so make sure that you understand how much force you need to apply to suck the water in. This will depend upon two factors - the general water pressure in your area and the size of the hot tub that you want to fill.</p>
