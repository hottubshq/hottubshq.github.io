<p>Other things to consider when thinking about adding a spa to your home are things like where is the water supply coming from, how heavy will it be and can it be supported, and also you need to take into consideration how many people may be using it.

Through the late 80's and the 90's I continued selling and installing primarily inground, or built in” swim spas.
