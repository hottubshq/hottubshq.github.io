<p>When people refer to a hot tub or a spa, they often think of the word Jacuzzi. When you exercise in one of these spas, you will be utilizing every muscle group in your body in a controlled setting. Given that the skill level to install a Jacuzzi bathtub is fairly high, most homeowners hire a pro. It produces a certain water current that allows you to swim there for as long as you want without hitting any walls.
