<p>That wonderful feeling you get whenever you sit back in a hot tub is because of the way your body reacts to the heat and jets of water. Jacuzzi® is the name that defines the hot tub experience. Our product range includes Steam Bath Unit, Sauna Bath Unit, Shower Enclosure, Bath Tubs, Jacuzzi Systems, Spa Product, Bathroom Accessories and similar other products. The spa tubs have a purification system attached to it. This system ensures that the water that enters the tub is cleaned of all contaminants. You want to be in your tub, not taking a bunch of time to maintain it. That's why Rich's has carried Leisure Time, the premier name in hot tub water care for over twenty-five years.</p>
<p>Take your soaking experience to the next level by adding Jacuzzi® Epsom Salt to your bathing ritual. Some swimming pool cleaning services experts recommend reducing pump operation to one hour per day until normal filtration cycle time is reached. Swim, exercise and relax with friends and family from the comforts and convenience of home.

<p>Other things to consider when thinking about adding a spa to your home are things like where is the water supply coming from, how heavy will it be and can it be supported, and also you need to take into consideration how many people may be using it. Now although you will probably have a fitter work everything out for you, make sure you question the plans as regards to any electrics and water supplies, so that you are clear in your own head that what they are suggesting can not only be implemented, but are also safe.</p>
<p>Vortex dual layer system keeps the heat from the pumps and plumbing, reduces noise and provides a warm layer between the water and the outside of the spa. The circulation pump, jet pump(s) and electronic control system of all Vortex swim spas are warranted against defects for 2 years. Friends and family can enjoy a pleasant time soaking in the warm water and chatting. You do have to be cautious about the quality of used hot tubs.</p>
