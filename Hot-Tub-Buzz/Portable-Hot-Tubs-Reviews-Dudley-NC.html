<p>Family owned Sacramento dealer offering affordable high quality Turbo Spas and Swim Spas. You are probably thinking, Yeah, this sounds great, but it probably costs like a trillion dollars.” That is a common misconception about Swim Spas…that they are only for the fabulously wealthy. Illumatherapy also offers four points of entry, with two on each side of the tub, and air bubbles spraying from the jets give the appearance of dancing as they reflect the light. The blowers make the hot tub feel like you've got your own personal geyser - forcing air from the bottom of the pool, and creating a very relaxing environment for you.</p>
<p>A night in my hot tub before bed and sometimes I the morning before work. The internet can be a perfect place to purchase a cheap hot tub instead of from a hot tub dealer's showroom, but be careful with internet hot tub retailers as they might not be genuine, they could be selling poor quality hot tubs or not be around in the future to support you with warranty problems or spare parts like filters. Not only the initial cost is lower than swim pools, but the use of water, the required heating, and the chemicals are less due to the size difference.</p>
<p>This new and innovative way to take your swim spa cover on and off makes swim spa sessions easier than ever. Jacuzzi developed the first hot tub pump 60 years ago and continues to provide innovative hydrotherapy products and features. For the ultimate in relaxation, a whirlpool bath is absolutely ideal for easing muscle tension & improving blood circulation, and now it's even easier to upgrade than ever. Be sure when ordering an Aqua Flow Viton seal kit that it will match the pump used in your Cal Spa, Marquis, Clearwater, Coleman or other spa brand that from time to time has used Aqua Flo pumps in their spas.</p>

Hot tubs and saunas are a great way to relax after a long day and both have been proven to provide several health benefits. Some Swim Spa units have just one body of water. This involves a considerable amount of extra work, however, as the ground in your backyard will have to be excavated before the installation can take place, just like it would with a regular inground swimming pool.</p>
<p>The Jacuzzi can be enjoyed at any time of the year, that is for a full 365 days, perhaps to cool off on a warm sultry day or to warm up on a winters evening.

Because we take pride in our products, Royal Spa swim spas have a lower cost of ownership than our competitors, though our sticker price will not be lowest you can find.</p>
