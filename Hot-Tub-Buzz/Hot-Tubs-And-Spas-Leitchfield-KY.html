As a fun way to unwind and relieve stress, hot tubs and home spas allow family members to have fun conversation while relaxing together.

<p>A Jacuzzi needs to have an energy saver system so as to be more economical in use and also to be more green to the planet - obviously an energy efficient hot tub will save the consumer money and use less precious energy thereby reducing ones carbon footprint which is very politically correct.

<p>In terms of price, portable hot tubs are more affordable than regular hot tubs. This allows a person, or pet, to soak in warm, relaxing water, while still swimming and exercising against a legitimate current and with plenty of space. An apple cider vinegar soak in a hot tub can help stop itching skin related to allergies or other dermatitis, as well as helping to take the heat out of a sunburn. A 2018 article on the company's website lists the health benefits people with no serious ailments can derive from a home swim spa: improved sleep, reduced stress, faster recovery from injuries, weight maintenance, reduced muscle pain, increased muscle strength and better flexibility.</p>
<p>Swimming pools used for competitions are usually found indoors and heated to allow usage anytime of the year and to more easily fulfill with the regulations regarding temperature, lighting, and equipment. Make sure when you drain and refill your tub that you use a true spa cleaning solution and let the jets run for 20-30 minutes, if not longer, before draining. Another little-publicized benefit is that swim spa workouts can help people improve their balance, according to another 2018 article by Rick McAvoy.</p>
