<p>That wonderful feeling you get whenever you sit back in a hot tub is because of the way your body reacts to the heat and jets of water. Jacuzzi® is the name that defines the hot tub experience. Our product range includes Steam Bath Unit, Sauna Bath Unit, Shower Enclosure, Bath Tubs, Jacuzzi Systems, Spa Product, Bathroom Accessories and similar other products. The spa tubs have a purification system attached to it. This system ensures that the water that enters the tub is cleaned of all contaminants. You want to be in your tub, not taking a bunch of time to maintain it. That's why Rich's has carried Leisure Time, the premier name in hot tub water care for over twenty-five years.</p>
<p>The most prominent safety feature walk-in tubs bring to the table — the door — also has a downside because you can't fill the tub with water before entering it, which could leave you a bit chilled. Hot tubs offer rest and relaxation. Swim spas are perfect for anyone who is looking for a healthy, low-impact way to exercise on a daily basis. And just like its namesake, great performance is exactly what you'll experience with the Michael Phelps Legend Series hot tub.</p>
<p>The 8' x 12' (94'' x 144'') Master Spas® swim spa replacement cover is a Master Spa Factory OEM replacement part (SKU: X454128). This Jacuzzi bathtub is the easiest way of bringing lavishness and grace with elegance to your lifestyle. This is a self-contained Swim Spa that has been set on the ground and then had a wood deck built around it. Notice that the body of water is all together (not separated into two areas).</p>

Hot tubs are sometimes also known as spas, or by the trade name Jacuzzi. Some Swim Spa units are separated into two distinct bodies of water. Weight loss spas, swim spas or beauty spas indulge and pamper yourself all the way to the glory.</p>

<p>However, the results can look sleek and sophisticated, enabling your swim spa to blend in more seamlessly with the rest of your property, and creating a dual-purpose swim spa plunge pool combination.
