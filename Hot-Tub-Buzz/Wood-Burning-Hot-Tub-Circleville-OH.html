<p>Design in hot tubs has no limits. Homeowners can also hire professionals to clean the Jacuzzi bathtubs for them. This type of hot tub is located in the privacy of your home so it is only viewable to people you are already comfortable with. Jacuzzi Pure Air tubs offer the unique experience of a steady stream of bubbles that soothe the body. Hot tubs have no such current, but the water often swirls and bubbles around sitters as they relax.</p>
