<p>If you are looking to have a swimming pool and hot tub combination, a two tank swim spa might be your best option.

In fact, some studies suggest aquatic exercise may be more effective than on-land workouts for some people with back ailments, according to an article by Rena Goldman in Pool & Spa News Like with osteoarthritis and bone and joints ailments, the secret here lies in the reduction of pressure on your joints provided by the buoyancy of the water.</p>

With regards to hot tubs, there are many companies out there trying to get you to buy their tubs with prices ranging for £1,000 up to £15,000 and the price you pay does affect the quality of the product slightly, as the more expensive ones will be a lot larger tub as well as having additional accessories like, TV, and sound systems built in.</p>
<p>You can still by spas and hot tubs under the Jacuzzi name. For example, a 60-gallon tub would require a 40-gallon water heater. As explained above, in the ‘What is the best filtration system for your spa pool” section, there are three main types of pumps, two-speed, single speed jet and single speed circulation. Unlike any other quality of hose, this particular PVC piping has the ability to withstand the spa pool environment of temperatures between -26 and +70 degrees Celsius.</p>
