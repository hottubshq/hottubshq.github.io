<p>In our modern, high-tech society, everything gets reviewed these days. After a long day, relaxing in the luxurious heat of your outdoor hot tub is just what you need to rejuvenate your mind and restore your body. Also the green view is one that is very much listened to by the hot tub industry resulting in much more ecological friendly Hot Tubs. By using a swim spa regularly you will get fit and toned by swimming. In 1990, Roy Jacuzzi® was placed in the National Kitchen and Bath Hall of Fame in the USA, recognising him for his many contributions in the innovation of hydrotherapy for home use.</p>
<p>Water constantly passes over the steel tube creating a consistent and reliable heating pattern. One of the greater benefits that comes with a swim spa is in the form of efficiency and portability. Hotel Alfonska offers for guests not only accommodation and meals, but the tennis courts or whirlpool for 4 persons too. Many swim spas also offer the option of swim jets in addition to the hydrotherapy jets. Baths, swimming pools, jacuzzi are turned off 10 minutes to closing of the Aqua Park.</p>
<p>The water resistance available at swim spas can help you in burning more calories than doing the same workout on drylands, losing weight and fat mass, and improving your fitness level.

There are two types of jets used in jetted bathtubs, water jets and air jets.</p>
<p>Swimming in a swim spa adds extra benefits. That is why if you notice, the jets are usually positioned at the most stressed muscles of the body - the calves, neck, some at the back, and at the sole of the feet. We favored those that sell spas with paddlewheel current systems, since they're usually the strongest. The bath water is recirculated through the jets, which keeps the water a bit warmer than air being forced in the bath.</p>
