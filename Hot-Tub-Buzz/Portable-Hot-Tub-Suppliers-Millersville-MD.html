<p>That wonderful feeling you get whenever you sit back in a hot tub is because of the way your body reacts to the heat and jets of water. Jacuzzi® is the name that defines the hot tub experience.

The wooden spa is heated by fire, is better outside and needs a fair bit of maintenance to keep it in good working order.</p>

The pump within your spa pool determines the overall quality and functioning of your whole spa.</p>
