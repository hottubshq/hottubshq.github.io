Sure, if your bathroom is too small for a hot tub, or any tub for that matter, you could always choose a massage shower. Install fencing or invest in a sturdy cover that kids can't fall though, even if they step on it. Also, pull up or remove ladders from above-ground models when not in use to prevent children from climbing into the pool or hot tub. An H2X Fitness Swim Spa allows you to exercise, relax, and entertain in the convenience and privacy of your backyard, year-round.</p>

<p>Compared to a pool, the ratio of people to volume of water is drastically different to in a spa, prompting unexpected spikes in pH. A jump in pH can cause the water to become alkaline and cloudy, leading to scale build up in your spa. In addition, swimming can be great for runners recovering from injuries since it not only helps maintain good physical health but also improves mental health. The insulation around the cabinet traps in waste heat created by the pumps and heater, greatly increasing the energy efficiency of the swim spa as a whole.</p>
