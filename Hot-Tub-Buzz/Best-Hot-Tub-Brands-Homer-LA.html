The food coloring will not damage any of the components in your hot tub, but you will have to drain it afterwards and refill it with fresh water. Of course, the Fastlane Pools Fitness System is so much more than a swim spa. There is a new invention called a Fast Lane Swim Jet unit that can be been retrofitted into most existing swimming pools.</p>
<p>You can purchase the Jacuzzi Luxura Bath Tub that will cost you about $559.00. This is the perfect bath tub for a consumer that may be on a tighter budget.
