<p>Jetted bathtubs are gaining in popularity. Sometimes, for people who are advanced in age or are very obese or are suffering from severe arthritis, swim spas provide the only available option. An easy to follow Spa & Hot Tub heater Troubleshooting Guide. Swimming pools are a great option, but may be too large for the area in your lawn. Unlike the technology-based saunas that the West uses, the Finnish sauna uses steam generated by throwing water over heated stones within the sauna room.</p>
<p>Swimlife is in the swimspa business for life and the only way to ensure success is to produce, offer and innovate the highest quality swimspas possible. Also, swim spas require a metal frame for support (which does not like being underground) and have the equipment (which requires access) inside the cabinet. Above ground hot tubs are freestanding basins that can be positioned anywhere, provided that there is connection to electric energy.</p>
<p>Your body opens up the blood vessels because it thinks you are getting too warm and the ones near the surface of the skin relax in an effort to release heat. In addition, we look for swim spa manufacturers that offer a variety of extras to enhance your swim spa experience, including spa covers, underwater workout equipment, sound systems, railings and LED lights. Best of all, it helps keep the Jacuzzi bathtub free of bacteria.</p>

Through the late 80's and the 90's I continued selling and installing primarily inground, or built in” swim spas. Old fashioned hot tub manufacturers and indeed those hot tubs that are not made to the very latest designs and standards use linked, jet-to-jet plumbing systems which can often result in the very first jet in the line being very powerful and the last jet being much less so.</p>
