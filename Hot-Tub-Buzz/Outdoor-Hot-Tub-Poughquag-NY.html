<p>Even though swim spas are hugely beneficial from a health and wellness perspective, they suffer from one major drawback. As swim spas are usually purchased by people with limited space, the average models are quite small compared to a full sized pool. Overall, considering the amount of features a swim spa has, it does offer good value, making it an attractive option, particularly if you are on a budget. Endless Pools is one of the first companies to develop this Swim Spa, or endless” swimming pool concept quite a number of years ago.</p>
<p>Another cost to consider is the price of hiring someone to professionally install the Jacuzzi bathtub. PDC Swim Spas and Fitness Spas are where innovation and fitness meet for a new approach to a healthier, happier lifestyle. In general, hot tubs cost less than swim spas, although very large, beautifully designed models can get pricey. That said, having a high-pressure hydro massage with warm water that is directed to specific body parts can help relieve aches and body pain.</p>
