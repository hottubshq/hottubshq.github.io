The insulation around the cabinet traps in waste heat created by the pumps and heater, greatly increasing the energy efficiency of the swim spa as a whole.</p>
<p>Swim Spas are smaller than typical swimming pools and this makes them much easier to drain for cleaning and maintenance.

<p>Jacuzzi bathtubs are considered a luxury and not something found in the average home. So, let's take a look at what's so great about these two hot tub brands. Just like hot tub spas, most Swim Spas are molded out of acrylic and are typically 12' - 24' in length. It is also worth inquiring on what type of insulation they have as some cheap hot tub will have none, and therefore cost more to run but some other cheap hot tubs are well insulated and will be cheaper to run.</p>

<p>Our swim spas provide the ideal training environment for both athletes and casual swimmers alike.
