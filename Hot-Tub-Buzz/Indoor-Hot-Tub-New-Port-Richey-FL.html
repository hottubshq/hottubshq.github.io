<p>In our modern, high-tech society, everything gets reviewed these days. As you are swimming in the sea you should not try to work harder than you would in a regular pool. Hot tubs are usually located outdoors, although they can be installed indoors. This is a patented technology; hence, you will not find this technology in any other ordinary swim spas. Using heat and the element of massage, Healthy Living Hot Tubs create one-of-a-kind hydrotherapy to ease aches and pain, calm stress and boost the natural healing response.</p>
<p>The heat widens blood vessels, which sends nutrient-rich blood throughout your body. With the optional integrated Wi-Fi module that works with the Balboa Water Group Wi-Fi Spa Control app, you can remotely control how your hot tub operates, including the lighting, water temperature and running massage pumps.

Its swim spas come in sizes between 1,792 and 2,700 gallons, and there are many jet options to choose from, depending on whether your spa is for family fun, therapy or a thorough workout.</p>
<p>We'll describe the average swim spa and compare that with both of the largest Hydropool models in the article below. Like all swimming pools, swim spa pools are available in a range of different sizes and shapes. The jets force out water into various points in the spa. Many times, people who choose swim spas are looking to avoid paying more for a swimming pool. Hot tubs refer to large tubs of hot water in which the person bathing is submerged.</p>

The first time I encountered a hot tub was when I was house-hunting with my wife. In 1968, Jacuzzi incorporated the hydrotherapy pump into the inside walls of its tubs, which created the first ever self-contained whirlpool.</p>
<p>These tubs have a 75 gallon capacity and is a great soaker bath to ease the stress away. First, by insulating the cabinet instead of the shell, Vortex spas recycles lost heat from the pumps and equipment, it also insulates the plumbing that would otherwise lose heat to the environment. Obviously when outside the Hot tub will be more exposed to the elements and you will need to wear bath slippers or equivalent as you walk to the Jacuzzi to keep the water as clear as possible.</p>
