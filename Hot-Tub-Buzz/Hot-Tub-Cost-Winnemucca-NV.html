<p>Jacuzzis are among the most popular addition to a luxury bathroom. The choice ranges from more classic wood-covered hot tubs, for a timeless elegance, to the most glamorous ones with faux leather covering, conceived to resist bed weather. There are hot tubs suitable for very small spaces and even unusual geometric designs. Swim spas, on the other hand, offer you the two options that you can choose from to suit the weather.

The first to transform bathing into an experience, Jacuzzi® leads the industry with new product styles and innovative hydrotherapy. I had very limited space and so a swimming pool wasn't an option.</p>
<p>One-piece hot tubs are popular because their manufacturing cost is lower than the wooden hot tubs. Size - With most swimming pools starting at a size of 18x36', they can take up a significant amount of our space. Fiberglass whirlpools have high pressure 'jets' that create a whirlpool effect.

You can easily assemble a swim spa together and use it as a portable swimming pool, wherever you go. Positioned to hit your shoulders and torso (jets that are too far apart or too low will not create the required resistance against the body and are a waste of water flow). Spas should also have a diverter valve to maintain water pressure on 1 or 2 seats.</p>

<p>In the pool most people simply swim lengths and you can choose whether to swim for a set amount of time, or a number of lengths. Hot tubs must always ALWAYS be kept clean. Sitting in a sauna bath increases skin temperature, causes the pulse rate to double, and thus, increases blood circulation.

<p>Although in the water, swimming is a strenuous sport that can induce dehydration - especially when one is swimming for long periods of time.
