<p>Indoor tubs may produce some moisture when in use, particularly if the ambient room temperature is much less than the water inside the vessel (hot tub water temperatures range from 100-104 degrees F). Those planning an indoor installation need to think about how long they'll use it and perhaps consider installing an exhaust fan to pull moisture from the room. The water inside a swim spa can provide a much more comfortable and enjoyable environment for low-impact exercise.</p>
<p>Hotels and resorts have public pools as part of their recreational facilities for their guests. It is commonly said, "where the head goes, the body follow." The swimmer eye should look down and out while submerged, allows water to flow more easily over the head and reduces frontal resistance.
