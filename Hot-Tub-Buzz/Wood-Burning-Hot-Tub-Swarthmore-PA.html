<p>Mums and Bubs swimming lesson sessions are designed for babies aged between 6 and 24 months. Many have what is known as thermal” spa facilities which basically means that there will be hydrotherapy pools, possibly steam rooms, ice caves, salt steam rooms, feature showers and maybe saunas at different temperatures. However, larger swim spas have dual-zone” heating; the primary section for the workouts is cold, while the second one for relaxing is hot.

Some swimming pool cleaning services experts recommend reducing pump operation to one hour per day until normal filtration cycle time is reached. Swim, exercise and relax with friends and family from the comforts and convenience of home. With multiple pumps you also get more and stronger massage jets as you can divert the water from the swim jets to the massage seats when you are not swimming.</p>
<p>Many public pools require women and men with long hair to wear a swim cap while in the pool. Salt can clog the motor that powers air or water jets on other brands or rust out the pump or heater. Heat pumps provide only great benefits when added to your spa pool or swim spa. Take a look at all the wonderful videos on our video page to get a feel for all the different pools, spas and swim spas on the market today.</p>
