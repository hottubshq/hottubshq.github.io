<p>We all know that spas and hot tubs have been around for numerous amounts of years, this being said the old economical spas always had there setbacks.

Hot Tub manufactures have improved the jets to give a better hydrotherapeutic effect. All swim spas, hot tubs , and Jacuzzis contain jets to mix air with pressurized water to provide a massage experience.

<p>With the combination of heat and humidity, and water - your body is more than likely losing water while swimming. Lastly, if the Jacuzzi tub does not have a self-cleaning feature, then it will require extra cleaning because even a little bit of water left in the tubing can lead to mold growth and spread of bacteria.

Relax with massaging spa jets in the perfect water temperature, year-round. The self-cleaning option helps keep the jets and the tubing that runs throughout the Jacuzzi bathtub clean. The you must consider also that where a hot tub is subject to regular use it will accumulate natural body oils, perspiration, and other material that may mark the water line.</p>
<p>Deluxe 4-person hot tub with 40 hydrotherapy massage jets and a full body lounge. Jets - Some Hydro Massage Jets would be a very good idea to introduce the water into the Hot Tub and here I would suggest not those simple bullet hole type that are un adjustable and are merely copied from decades ago but those that are fully adjustable.
