<p>One of the most obvious benefits of using a swimming pool and spa, for the average person, is the simple act of relaxation. These tubs are usually made to accommodate two to four people and are made from plastic or vinyl. Not only will the Vortex Hybrid Heat Pump heat your spa economically. We provide this Corner Jacuzzi Bathtubon several designs & other related options as per the needs of customers. After an hour of soaking in the 100-104 degree waters, enjoy a health-promoting massage by one of our nationally certified and state licensed massage therapists offering a range of massage modalities from relaxation to deeper more therapeutic massages.</p>
<p>With the burgeoning interest in health and leisure across the United States, yet another opportunity was spotted in the 1960s, by Roy Jacuzzi, who invented and marketed the first self-contained, fully-integrated whirlpool bath, creating a whole new industry almost on his own. In short, hot tubs and Jacuzzis are not the same. Tests have proven that through having a heat pump within your spa pool or swim spa, running costs are reduced by over 50%, resulting in shortened and achievable payback period.</p>
<p>A pool spa is used for people who have plenty of room in their yard and who want the best of both worlds for their swimming and relaxation pleasure. If you don't have kids or plan to only use your spa for swimming and exercise, a one tank spa might work out better. All Vortex Swim Spas are big enough for inflatable toys right up to a floating lounger. This company has five lines of swim spas: AquaPlay, AquaTrainer, ExecutiveTrainer, AquaSport and ExecutiveSport.</p>

The circulation pump, jet pump(s) and electronic control system of all Vortex swim spas are warranted against defects for 2 years. Friends and family can enjoy a pleasant time soaking in the warm water and chatting. You do have to be cautious about the quality of used hot tubs.</p>

<p>The Company offers hot tubs and accessories, such as covers and lifts, synthetic accessories, hot tub complements, and water purification systems. During the 1960's, Roy Jacuzzi took over the business and then started marketing and selling the first Jacuzzi hot tub using the same jet systems that was invented by this family. You may want to consider how many people you will need to accommodate, budget and available space designated for your hot tub.</p>
<p>Swim spas vary dramatically in cost depending on size, jet power, features and installation. They have this feature wherein an adjustable water current will be applied in the pool part so you can swim laps and laps without hitting the walls nor turning around. Get all these things right and you will never regret buying a Jacuzzi tub, so seek professional help when selecting a hot tub for your home - you can often try them out at the dealers shop too.</p>
<p>Swim spas are not an ideal choice for families, as only one person can comfortably swim in a swim spa at any time. The Jacuzzi brand tradition of innovation in hydro-massage has made Jacuzzi the most desired product in whirlpool bathing. Our spas come with valuable customer and technical support for the lifetime of the spa.
