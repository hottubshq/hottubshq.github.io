<p>A spa or hot tub should be shocked with the appropriate sanitizer after use. Hot tub water chemicals, especially chlorine have a specific formula that lasts in hot water won't turn the water cloudy and has the right pH for hot tubbing. When spas are created with less than 4 layers it will be made evident through the shorter warranties that accompany the spa pool as its lifespan will be dramatically shortened.</p>
<p>The Jacuzzi Walk-In is designed to fit in the place of a standard bathtub, so it's the perfect choice for bathroom renovations as well as for replacing existing walk-in bathtubs. There is an inset within a wooden deck, so that it is easy to enter the hot tub. Some hot tubs need to be installed on a pedestal so that it is not directly touching the ground, but many inflatable or pop up” hot tubs don't require this kind of groundwork.</p>
