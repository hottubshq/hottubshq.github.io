<p>In the pool most people simply swim lengths and you can choose whether to swim for a set amount of time, or a number of lengths. Hot tubs must always ALWAYS be kept clean. Sitting in a sauna bath increases skin temperature, causes the pulse rate to double, and thus, increases blood circulation. Today, Jacuzzi features an expanded luxury tub environment, with four types of therapeutic tubs. Our hot tubs are extremely durable, but should anything go wrong, you won't be left high and dry.</p>

That's why swim spas are definitely cheaper when it comes to their initial cost. Though the J-200 collection features entry-level pricing, these Jacuzzi® hot tubs are packed with features including CLEARRAY® water purification, numerous jets, and spacious designs.</p>
