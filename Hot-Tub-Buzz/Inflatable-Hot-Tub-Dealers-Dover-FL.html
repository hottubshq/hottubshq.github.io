<p>The hot tub is an attractive and strong focal point when added as a new feature in a home. The Indulgence swim spa is the top of the line for us at Sunbelt Spas. Although ABS based acrylic has proven strength, fibreglass is still sometimes added in order to ensure it maintains its strength alongside supporting the spas water and bather load. When your bathroom space is limited, a corner tub can give you the most out of the space. The next big leap forward came when the Jacuzzi brothers hydrotherapy pump was combined with fibreglass bodywork, a filtration system and electric heating system to create what is essentially the modern day hot tub.</p>

If it doesn't say ” for hot tubs and spas” on the label, don't buy it. Every backyard, every budget and every customer can have a different definition of when the best time to buy a hot tub is. It is with this is mind, that I am writing this blog to help you to decide when the best time is for you to purchase is.</p>

Emerging yourself into the warm waters of a Hot Tub or Spa can actually help your health. It doesn't hurt to sit in a bathtub of hot water because your upper body generally is not fully submerged and the materials used to build tubs cool the water quickly, unlike swim spa materials and systems.</p>
