<p>When people refer to a hot tub or a spa, they often think of the word Jacuzzi. When you exercise in one of these spas, you will be utilizing every muscle group in your body in a controlled setting. Given that the skill level to install a Jacuzzi bathtub is fairly high, most homeowners hire a pro. It produces a certain water current that allows you to swim there for as long as you want without hitting any walls. We had a jacuzzi tub in our old home and the jets never seemed clean no matter what I tried.</p>
<p>Unlike a swimming pool, there is no requirement to excavate your backyard. It was one of those gazebo hot tubs set up in the back yard and I was really pleasantly surprised to come across a jacuzzi. That's why swim spas are definitely cheaper when it comes to their initial cost.

<p>It's also possible that you might be wanting to build a permanent hydrotherapy pool maybe as an addition to your own pool in your garden in which case this would be referred to as a spa. Swim spas usually only have seating at one end with 2 or 4 powerful swim jets at the other. If you're thinking about investing in a swim spa, you're probably interested in its health and exercise benefits.
