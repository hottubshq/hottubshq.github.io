<p>Buying a used spa is another way of acquiring a hot tub without paying full price. If the swim spas are not cleaned or maintained from time to time, you will not enjoy the swimming experience due to the dirt collected and the bad odor emitted from the swim spa. One of the most overlooked areas in an all season pool is the ability of the unit to provide benefits outside the swim and massage.
