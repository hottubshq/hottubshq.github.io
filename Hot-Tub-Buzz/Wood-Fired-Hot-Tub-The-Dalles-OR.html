<p>A lot of people ask what is the difference between a swim spa and a swimming pool? When you install your hot tub or pool you may or may not have used conduit or a duct that is buried in your garden for protecting the cables, if there is spare capacity, you can feed your power and cable leads through the duct to the location normally on a wall near the pool or hot tub. While some spas still use wooden tubs, there are many private spas that use specially designed hot tubs and whirlpools to create a relaxing atmosphere for their clients while still using the healing power of warm water.</p>
<p>It is suggested to hire a professional and qualified architect or supplier to figure out the right way to install the tub or spas in the balcony garden. If salt levels are too high or too low the water will not be sanitized and damage can be caused to other areas of your spa pool as a result. At Amazon Hot Tubs, we help you find the right accessories for you and your family's needs and offer free professional installation of all accessories with the purchase of one our spas.</p>
