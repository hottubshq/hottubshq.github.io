<p>A guy named Dr. Stephen Blair (University of South Carolina) conducted an extended survey to study the effectiveness of swimming for fitness. All swim spa covers are made specifically to fit your Master Spas swim spa and come 6" thick in the middle and taper off to 4". This cover includes an energy efficient 1.5 lb foam density and a 24 R-value, with a full length heat seal and upgraded rubber grip handles (included!). We had limited space and the swim spa allowed us to maximise the use of our garden and has proven to be far more economical than a pool.</p>
<p>The drastic price difference while having the same benefits give swim spas an advantage over the other options. There are Hot tub on the marketplace now that are designed for two people only; therefore the tubs are much smaller to the traditional larger hot tubs. These smaller sized swim spas can still accommodate several bathers, although if you're taller than average it might feel a little small. Another great characteristic that comes with owning a swim spa is that its maintenance is so much easier then it would be with owning a swimming pool.</p>
<p>Instead of looking at horsepower, though, make sure you consider the swim spas GPM, or gallons per minute rating. The HL 8DL is a great hot tub to relax in, the Healthy Living 8 Dual Lounge provides reclined seating for two at once, 44 hydrotherapy jets, and LED lighting. But hot tubs are not all the same as one another and the qualifications of their makers differ as well. Most mid-range swim spas are also built with more equipment that is designed for swim spas.</p>
