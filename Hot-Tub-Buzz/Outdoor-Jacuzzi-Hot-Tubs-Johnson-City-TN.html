<p>Instead of forking out more than $70k on a pool, many resorts to owning a spa swim that started with $14k. Swim spas can be used for many types of exercise, beyond the invigorating workouts you get swimming against the resistance current. In contrast to a typical bathtub , a hot tub is designed to be used by more than one person at a time, with many models accommodating four or more people. There are many companies that carry jetted tubs, some of the most well known include American Standard and Whirlpool bathtubs.</p>
