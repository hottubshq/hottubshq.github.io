<p>Spas are resorts or health centers that provide theurepatic baths and treatment. We've had hot tubs in the past and decided we wanted something simple this time. It is advisable for people suffering from diarrhea, skin infections, intestinal infections or fresh wounds on any part of the body not to use the hot tubs.
