Get an ergonomic experience in the kitchen with a Jacuzzi® farmhouse apron sink Bring a little decadence home from Lowe's today. Our Wellness Spas® feature the ability not only to swim in place endlessly against a powerful counter-current, but also to strength-train and even experience a therapeutic hydrotherapy massage.</p>
