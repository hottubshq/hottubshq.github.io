<p>When people refer to a hot tub or a spa, they often think of the word Jacuzzi. When you exercise in one of these spas, you will be utilizing every muscle group in your body in a controlled setting. Given that the skill level to install a Jacuzzi bathtub is fairly high, most homeowners hire a pro. It produces a certain water current that allows you to swim there for as long as you want without hitting any walls. We had a jacuzzi tub in our old home and the jets never seemed clean no matter what I tried.</p>
<p>With the burgeoning interest in health and leisure across the United States, yet another opportunity was spotted in the 1960s, by Roy Jacuzzi, who invented and marketed the first self-contained, fully-integrated whirlpool bath, creating a whole new industry almost on his own. In short, hot tubs and Jacuzzis are not the same. Tests have proven that through having a heat pump within your spa pool or swim spa, running costs are reduced by over 50%, resulting in shortened and achievable payback period.</p>

Exercise pools allow you to exercise harder and work your body in a different ways than swimming laps in a regular sized pool. Spending time in a swim spa can even help improve your mental and emotional health. Just like in the case of hot tubs, keep well-hydrated and get out as soon as you experience any sign of discomfort.</p>

<p>Sure, you eat right and exercise, but to really live well, you should add in a bit of hydrotherapy with a Healthy Living Hot Tub. With a large volume of water like this (between 600-2000 gallons depending on the size) it will be somewhat costly to heat up to hot tub temperatures though. In 2001, the Jacuzzi® bathroom brand was expanded in the UK to include sanitaryware, premium shower enclosures, furniture, brassware and accessories to offer a full contemporary bathroom collection.</p>
<p>When hot tubs aren't cleaned well, their moist environment is the perfect breeding ground for bacteria. Although better than low-end swim spas, many mid-range swim spa swim currents still lack power and smoothness To overcome this, the manufacturer will often include a swim tether system to keep you in place and prevent you from out-swimming the current. Hot tubs are large tubs of hot water that can be used to relax and entertain.</p>
<h3>Are Swim Spas Worth The Investment in  Maple Grove</h3>
<p>When you start shopping for Jacuzzi tubs, there are a number of issues to bear in mind.

As part of our research we also spoke with a regional representative for Master Spas Kevin Richards explained some of the inside workings of the industry, what to look for, questions to ask and where to purchase a swim spa.</p>
<p>Initially, they took to soaking in hot water filled wine barrels and other large wooden vessels and they, logically enough, called these hot tubs. When you use a sauna, jacuzzi, hot tub or steam room, your body is unable to lose heat effectively by sweating. The acidic quality of vinegar eats away at oily residue that has built up in the tub as well as the calcium and other chemical deposits in the jets and tubing.</p>
<p>Experience the heated-water hydrotherapy and jetted hydromassage benefits of a hot tub, with the increased hydrostatic-pressure benefits of a swim spa. Sure, the waters were colder than I usually like, and my body had to endure a bit of punishment it's not accustomed to (plus, there's shrinkage), but the thrill generated by the competition convinced me that adding open water swims to my racing repertoire is a definite must.</p>
