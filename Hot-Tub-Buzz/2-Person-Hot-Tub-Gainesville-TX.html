<p>Riptide swim spas and exercise pools delivered and installed by our experienced team. Hot water is a great way to keep the body moving. A Jacuzzi soaking tub is the most common type of tub, and this basic concept is Jacuzzi's foundation for hydrotherapy tubs. Some hot tubs also come with features that Jacuzzi products do not, such as flat-screen TVs and built-in MP3 audio systems. Our Swim Spa River Jets are each powered solely by a 4 HP (6BHP) Hyper Flow Jet Pump. Having the swim spa completely above ground is another option that allows you to fence only the steps (as long as the swim spa is over 1200mm high the height of pool fencing).</p>
<p>In 1956, the Jacuzzi family created a portable hydrotherapy pump to help treat a family member's painful arthritis. This creates a stronger massage than tubs with the air jets. Equipped with classic filtration systems and just one or two pumps depending on the model, these J-200 Jacuzzi® hot tubs are among Jacuzzi's most affordable models. Swim spas are flexible, durable and practical. In just a few years' time, Jacuzzi became a household name and was quickly used to refer to any and all hot tubs, however incorrectly.</p>
<p>Bathroom was spacious and the tub was a nice feature. Like cars, not all swim spas are alike. You could also purchase the Jacuzzi Bath Tubs that have the model number of BA06. Single zone swim spas with 2 or 3 jet pumps require a 32 amp direct wired power supply (and isolation switch) and dual zone and professional swim spas require up to 60 amps (dual zone swim spas will supply two separate power supplies). A jet system creates a smooth current of water ideal for fitness activities, and massage jets offer relief from stress, aches, and muscle pain.</p>

<p>3. Length of time in business - If a company started manufacturing 2 years ago and is offering a 10 year warranty, even they cannot be sure that the spa will last for it's warranty period. Hot tubs and saunas are a great way to relax after a long day and both have been proven to provide several health benefits. Some Swim Spa units have just one body of water. This involves a considerable amount of extra work, however, as the ground in your backyard will have to be excavated before the installation can take place, just like it would with a regular inground swimming pool.</p>
<p>This Limited Warranty only covers those items manufactured by Clearwater Spas. It gives away pressure to those muscles to release stress, and promote relaxation through the water circulation. Many people would love a sound system in the hot tub as well TV but many can not afforded these luxuries and therefore looking for a cheap hot tubs. However some manufacturers have also molded some hot tub seating into the ends of their Swim Spas, so you can relax in them as well.</p>

<p>It's also possible that you might be wanting to build a permanent hydrotherapy pool maybe as an addition to your own pool in your garden in which case this would be referred to as a spa. Swim spas usually only have seating at one end with 2 or 4 powerful swim jets at the other. If you're thinking about investing in a swim spa, you're probably interested in its health and exercise benefits. The water is hot and the jets are powerful which I find amazing for a 110 V appliance.</p>
<p>A therapeutic spa and swimming pool combined into one, swim spas are designed with more space for exercise and play at one end and the benefits of hydro massage at the other. She won a free Jacuzzi® J-245 hot tub. In comparison to maintenance and heating of an average inbuilt swimming pool, swim spas are lower on running costs. Your sore aching neck and back muscles will love our spas water and air jets. We are proud to be your online retailer of H2X swim spa covers and Michael Phelps swim spas covers.</p>
<p>According to promotional information we received from Hydropool, the company's self-cleaning spas like the AquaTrainer 14 fX can filter 100 percent of their water in 45 minutes. Your swim spa can be heated to the temperature of your choice. Jacuzzi may have been the first well known hot tub brand, but they may not offer the most affordable spas for sale on today's market. Shell - The part that contains the water and where you sit the body of the actual Hot Tub is referred to as the Shell.</p>

<p>The jet system commonly installed in a whirlpool tub, hot tub, or outdoor spa provides a massaging motion that targets the muscle groups in the body. Hot tub pump replacements, parts, impellers, wet ends and seals can be ordered online with quick shipping in order to complete a repair and get the spa working properly again.

Get the portability of an above-the-ground pool , the endless swimming of a lap pool, and the hydrotherapy of a hot tub all rolled into one. Above ground swim spas also have the added advantage of being portable, so that if you ever decide to move house, you can take your swim spa with you, enabling you to get the most out of your investment.</p>
<p>The deep penetrating moist heat relaxes the muscles and expands the blood vessels, creating a sedative effect on the nervous system. Hydrotherapy in a hot tub provides relief for high blood pressure because it dilates or opens up blood vessels so the heart doesn't have to pump as hard. Enjoy the benefits of aquatic fitness in the comfort and privacy of your home, with a variety of low-impact activities to keep your body limber and feeling good.</p>
<p>3. Programmable circulation pumps-This system is larger and has the option to be time programmed on how long you want it to run for, dependable on how often your spa is being used meaning they are energy efficient. Beside the obvious benefits of using spa covers which will help keep your spa clean and safe to use, your spa tub also can also affect your body's blood and blood vessels in different beneficial ways.</p>
