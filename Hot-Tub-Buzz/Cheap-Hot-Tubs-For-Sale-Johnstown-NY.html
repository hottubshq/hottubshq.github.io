<p>You will find that there are many manufacturers of bath tubs on the market today but only one name really stands above the rest. Jacuzzi Water Villas are water bungalows in the Maldives, located over-the-water, in the lagoon… a short walk along your private jetty to this secluded hideaway featuring a larger bedroom, wood floor, espresso machine, a spacious bathroom, a private walled-in outdoor area featuring a Jacuzzi for two under the stars”, a wooden sundeck with chaise lounges, a shaded area, tropical plants, a private sundeck with stairs into the sea and the most magnificent views of all.</p>
<p>The difference with swim spas is that they're often larger than a standard spa pool and have an open area at one end without seating. If an Extreme Lighting Package is installed on your spa, each corner will light up to match the color of light in your hot tub. When you allow the massaging jets to massage your sore spots or even just hold your feet up to the circulating massaging water you will immediately feel better and your feet won't hurt much at all.</p>
<p>The jet system commonly installed in a whirlpool tub, hot tub, or outdoor spa provides a massaging motion that targets the muscle groups in the body. Hot tub pump replacements, parts, impellers, wet ends and seals can be ordered online with quick shipping in order to complete a repair and get the spa working properly again. Swim spas with poor purification systems will require extra money (and time) spent on chemicals.</p>

You may want to consider how many people you will need to accommodate, budget and available space designated for your hot tub.</p>
<p>Since a whirl pool is a place where people spend a considerable amount of time inside, it should have good wide panoramic views so as to avoid monotony and boredom. Swim spas offer all the comfort and benefits of hot tubs, but they come in a larger size, almost like a small swimming pool. Start by thinking about how you plan to use the swim spa — therapy, relaxation, exercise or all of the above. The Jacuzzi water heater model is the king of them all.</p>
