<p>Swimming accessories are important for summer safety if you plan on swimming. With Jacuzzi for Life, you have the option of purchasing any 300, 400, 500 or LX series hot tub. Innovative jet pump & equipment technology and newer manufacturing methods made the cost of production of the Swim Spa to come down to the levels of a high quality portable hot tub. The biggest factor to consider in terms of cost is the price of the Jacuzzi bathtub itself. Many people ask themselves if it's worth it to invest in a swim spa.</p>
<p>A hot tub used to be seen as a luxury item that people could only dream of owning one day. But endless swimming is just the beginning, because modern swim spas offer powerful hydro - massaging jets for complete rejuvenation and relaxation after a hard workout or anytime the mood strikes. Staying fit and living well is easy with the Vitality Series Fitness Spas, pleasing both your wellness goals and budget.</p>
<p>Here, we'll learn more about the differences between a hot tub and a Jacuzzi.

<p>Over the past 2 years we've been helping customers with swim spas determine the best care program for their individual needs and addressing their individual concerns. The length of your swim spa area should be the height of the tallest swimmer in your household with their arms outstretched plus around a metre so you don't touch the jets or kick the seats while swimming. The health benefits from increased circulation and such that you get from the water jets you do not get with an air jetted bathtub.</p>

<p>With the burgeoning interest in health and leisure across the United States, yet another opportunity was spotted in the 1960s, by Roy Jacuzzi, who invented and marketed the first self-contained, fully-integrated whirlpool bath, creating a whole new industry almost on his own.

Tests have proven that through having a heat pump within your spa pool or swim spa, running costs are reduced by over 50%, resulting in shortened and achievable payback period.</p>

<p>Master Spas' patented EcoPur® Charge Water Filtration System minimizes maintenance while providing crystal clear water. For example, the first time you use your new tub and try to remove its bulky 7'x7' cover, you will quickly understand the value of a hydraulic cover lifter: a device that makes it a breeze to open and close your cover. There are hot tubs made for only one, and they go up in size from there. The word spa refers to a tub filled with water that has heat for the water and jets to spray the water and circulate it throughout the tub.</p>
<p>Neither of these options add major benefits to your overall spa experience. Many people do jogging and running exercises, but swimming is a popular alternative for those who either don't enjoy running or might have joint issues, as exercising in water produces less stress on your legs and joints.
