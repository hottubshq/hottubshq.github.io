Swim spas are mostly shaped like a traditional swimming pool, but they also include jets like a hot tub.</p>

In contrast to a typical bathtub , a hot tub is designed to be used by more than one person at a time, with many models accommodating four or more people. There are many companies that carry jetted tubs, some of the most well known include American Standard and Whirlpool bathtubs.</p>
