<p>OK, class ~ it's time to define the true meaning of the different types of hot water therapy. It has the new River Jet swim system with Viper pumps, and plenty of water features. Whisper-quiet motors, colorful lighting, dancing air bubbles, powerful jets — your bath is an expression of yourself and an extension of how you want to feel. Most indoor kinds hold one or two people simply because the available space is limited to the standard size bathroom. Similar to a regular bathtub you would see in a home, these hot tubs, sometimes called whirlpool baths or Jacuzzis, are filled with water for each use than drained when your soaking is complete.</p>
<p>Swim spas definitely are not cheap, but they are about half the price of a nice pool. In pools, you worry about turns, running into the wall, or jumping too deep that you hit the ground, swim spas erase these concerns and the possibility of these incidents. Jacuzzi is the company that brought hydrotherapy to the market more than 50 years ago with their hot tubs, and it is clear they are the leading experts in the industry.</p>
<p>As a different alternative to an above ground swim spa, you could consider a Little Pool These are smaller versions of full-sized fibreglass swimming pools, made to the same high standards, but they are portable, easy to install, and instant to use. Jacuzzi still to this day continues to innovate & lead the hot tub industry forward. One of the most overlooked areas in a swimspa is the ability of the unit to provide benefits outside the swim and massage.</p>

<p>Another advantage of portable hot tubs are they can be looked after much better, lets just say that you were having a terrible winter, with a normal hot tub you would only be able to cover the tub which would ultimately still lead to wear and tear throughout the year.

<p>If your hot tub is freestanding, you will need to provide steps so that people can climb into the tub and step onto the seating area.
