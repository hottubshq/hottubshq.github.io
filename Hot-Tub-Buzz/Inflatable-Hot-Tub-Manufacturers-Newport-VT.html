<p>A night in my hot tub before bed and sometimes I the morning before work. The internet can be a perfect place to purchase a cheap hot tub instead of from a hot tub dealer's showroom, but be careful with internet hot tub retailers as they might not be genuine, they could be selling poor quality hot tubs or not be around in the future to support you with warranty problems or spare parts like filters.

<p>Other things to consider when thinking about adding a spa to your home are things like where is the water supply coming from, how heavy will it be and can it be supported, and also you need to take into consideration how many people may be using it.
