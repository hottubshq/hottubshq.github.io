<p>While it is rather unfortunate, from time to time your hot tub may have a leak in it. Thankfully, there are some easy methods that you can implement that allow you to locate the leak and have it fixed. If you've yet to explore the incredible benefits of swim spas, here's your chance.

Number of jets versus number of pumps-Your average spa water pump should support a maximum of 30 jets. The setup is easy enough on this one, but heating the tub is slow going.</p>
<p>The drastic price difference while having the same benefits give swim spas an advantage over the other options. There are Hot tub on the marketplace now that are designed for two people only; therefore the tubs are much smaller to the traditional larger hot tubs. These smaller sized swim spas can still accommodate several bathers, although if you're taller than average it might feel a little small. Another great characteristic that comes with owning a swim spa is that its maintenance is so much easier then it would be with owning a swimming pool.</p>

<p>Swim spas and spa pools (also known as portable spas or hot tubs) are very similar. We only needed ten shifts in the water (two of our teammates only had to swim once), which I thought was pretty impressive for a group of mostly-first timers. It was basic and even rudimentary, but from that moment on I have been obsessed with swim spas.

<p>Whether it's a more affordable model you seek or a swim spa with extras - like a built-in LCD TV screen and ice bucket perfect for keeping refreshments cold - we welcome you to come to our showroom and browse our excellent options available in swim spas. The smaller volume of water is less maintenance to keep clean and swimming pools can't typically provide hot water for use throughout the colder months of winter.</p>
<p>Of course, every Endless Pools Fitness System is so much more than a spa. Most of the hot tubs especially cheap imports from the east of the world are created using cheap methods, from people that probably have no expertise in the trade and are just following regular instructions from there team managers. Swimming pools make a great sand-less alternative, but laps in a public pool aren't always possible, and, of course, not private, and installing and maintaining your own pool may be too costly, not to mention the fact that you can't take it with you if you move or you may simply not have the space to accommodate one.</p>
