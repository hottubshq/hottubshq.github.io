<p>Every summer the open water swimming season peppers the calendar, and for years I have shrugged it off with complete apathy. Initially, they took to soaking in hot water filled wine barrels and other large wooden vessels and they, logically enough, called these hot tubs. When you use a sauna, jacuzzi, hot tub or steam room, your body is unable to lose heat effectively by sweating. The acidic quality of vinegar eats away at oily residue that has built up in the tub as well as the calcium and other chemical deposits in the jets and tubing.</p>
<p>Another cost to consider is the price of hiring someone to professionally install the Jacuzzi bathtub. PDC Swim Spas and Fitness Spas are where innovation and fitness meet for a new approach to a healthier, happier lifestyle. In general, hot tubs cost less than swim spas, although very large, beautifully designed models can get pricey. That said, having a high-pressure hydro massage with warm water that is directed to specific body parts can help relieve aches and body pain.</p>
<p>The three different kinds of containers used for hot tubs are wooden barrels, fibreglass whirlpools, or large bathtubs. Michael Phelps Signature Swim Spas were developed with input from 23-time gold medalist Michael Phelps and his coach Bob Bowman for all types of training, swimming, fitness programs and aquatic therapy. For people looking to rid their bodies of excess toxins and water, a jacuzzi provides a great opportunity for body detoxification.</p>
