<p>The most prominent safety feature walk-in tubs bring to the table — the door — also has a downside because you can't fill the tub with water before entering it, which could leave you a bit chilled. Hot tubs offer rest and relaxation. Swim spas are perfect for anyone who is looking for a healthy, low-impact way to exercise on a daily basis. And just like its namesake, great performance is exactly what you'll experience with the Michael Phelps Legend Series hot tub.</p>

<p>And while a number of studies have touted the benefits of swimming over every other form of exercise (including jogging and walking!), and include swimming as a recommended form of exercise for everything from increasing the chances of conception in women to easing the suffering of those with Fibromyalgia, very few insurance plans offer any sort of coverage or assistance when making the purchase of a swimming spa.</p>
<p>Buying a used spa is another way of acquiring a hot tub without paying full price. If the swim spas are not cleaned or maintained from time to time, you will not enjoy the swimming experience due to the dirt collected and the bad odor emitted from the swim spa. One of the most overlooked areas in an all season pool is the ability of the unit to provide benefits outside the swim and massage. These are common pressure areas and jetted bathtubs know how to attack what ails you.</p>
<p>You even hear stories of people that buy cheap eastern hot tubs and they do not get the cover for the hot tub till months later. Aquatic exercise in a swim spa can be helpful for people with chronic conditions, but Schulte said it varies by person. The Balboa Water Group also offers various parts for the maintenance, upgrading and repair of the hot tub, said parts of which will include hydromassage jets, LED lights for chromatherapy, blowers, heaters and pumps, to name just a few.</p>
<p>Sure, if your bathroom is too small for a hot tub, or any tub for that matter, you could always choose a massage shower. Install fencing or invest in a sturdy cover that kids can't fall though, even if they step on it. Also, pull up or remove ladders from above-ground models when not in use to prevent children from climbing into the pool or hot tub. An H2X Fitness Swim Spa allows you to exercise, relax, and entertain in the convenience and privacy of your backyard, year-round.</p>
