<p>Even though swim spas are hugely beneficial from a health and wellness perspective, they suffer from one major drawback. As swim spas are usually purchased by people with limited space, the average models are quite small compared to a full sized pool. Overall, considering the amount of features a swim spa has, it does offer good value, making it an attractive option, particularly if you are on a budget. Endless Pools is one of the first companies to develop this Swim Spa, or endless” swimming pool concept quite a number of years ago.</p>
<p>Due to the advanced design and high-grade materials that's used to craft each and every Hydropool Swim Spa, they can offer many years of use. It is smaller than a regular swimming pool, but larger than a spa, so it offers enough space to swim in. However, like a spa, it is equipped with spa jets, so you can enjoy the benefits of relaxation and pain relief that hydrotherapy offers. This is why we have designed our swim spas from the ground up to be used all year.</p>
<p>Bathroom was spacious and the tub was a nice feature. Like cars, not all swim spas are alike. You could also purchase the Jacuzzi Bath Tubs that have the model number of BA06. Single zone swim spas with 2 or 3 jet pumps require a 32 amp direct wired power supply (and isolation switch) and dual zone and professional swim spas require up to 60 amps (dual zone swim spas will supply two separate power supplies). A jet system creates a smooth current of water ideal for fitness activities, and massage jets offer relief from stress, aches, and muscle pain.</p>
