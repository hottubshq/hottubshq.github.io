<p>Hydropool's Self-Cleaning 570 is a 5 person hot tub that is perfect for two couples. If you're considering an online supplier, Google them to see what type of experiences other customers have had and remember that the cost of the swim spa itself will only be part of the overall cost including delivery, concrete base, fencing and certifier and permit fees. Besides the above there are a few other major differences that can be seen between the two, which we will now take a more in-depth look at, and also approach the benefits that a swim spa can bring.</p>
<p>It is important to note, though, that the overall size of a swim spa is different from the amount of usable swimming space it contains. Most swim spas found in Canada fall into the mid-range category; costing between $20,000-$35,000. Your swim spa will be the perfect outlet for relaxation, leisure, fun with family. The temperature in an unheated walk-in tub drops to 98.6 in 10 minutes, requiring the bather to add more hot water to remain comfortable.</p>

Cheaper spas sometimes reduce the size of the unit to make up for these cuts.</p>
<p>When hot tubs aren't cleaned well, their moist environment is the perfect breeding ground for bacteria. Although better than low-end swim spas, many mid-range swim spa swim currents still lack power and smoothness To overcome this, the manufacturer will often include a swim tether system to keep you in place and prevent you from out-swimming the current. Hot tubs are large tubs of hot water that can be used to relax and entertain.</p>
