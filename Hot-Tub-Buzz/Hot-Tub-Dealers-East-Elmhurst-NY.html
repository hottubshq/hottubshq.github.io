<p>Atlantic City is for Lovers, hot tub lovers that is. Here are our top picks for the best Hotel and Casino Jacuzzi experiences. A choice that combines Jacuzzi® reliability, quality and value. Spa filters help to remove impurities from the water and ensure your spa pool water is safe for you, your family and friends.

<p>Keep young children away from spas or hot tubs unless there is constant adult supervision. The food coloring will not damage any of the components in your hot tub, but you will have to drain it afterwards and refill it with fresh water.

There is a new invention called a Fast Lane Swim Jet unit that can be been retrofitted into most existing swimming pools.</p>
