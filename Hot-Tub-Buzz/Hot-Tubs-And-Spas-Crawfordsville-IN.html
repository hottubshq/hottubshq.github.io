This state-of-the-art spa is designed in accordance to European standards and gives a smooth swimming experience. We are one of the trusted names engaged in designing SPA Pools that are appreciated for their comfortable sitting, powerful jets and easy to use controls. Second hand hot tubs tend to still command reasonably high prices even after allowing for their age. 35 swimming jets and 37 spa jets. Owning an at-home pool or hot tub can be fun for the whole family.</p>
<p>Look for pools that offer a strong, adjustable current so you to change the water from a low speed for easy workouts and rehab to higher speeds for full intensity swimming or fitness routines. Owning a swimming pool is a privilege but to enjoy a nice beautiful pool with minimum hassles and expense requires some basic responsibilities.

Now the price of a Swim Spa seems very reasonable when compared to a $16,000 hot tub or a $40,000 inground pool. For all swim spas, be sure to maintain a chlorine level of about 1.0 - 2.0 ppm or if using bromine, 2.0 - 4.0 ppm. Meanwhile, the permanent hydrotherapy pools in the spas became known as spas or spa pools themselves just to make life a little more complicated.</p>

<p>Many have what is known as thermal” spa facilities which basically means that there will be hydrotherapy pools, possibly steam rooms, ice caves, salt steam rooms, feature showers and maybe saunas at different temperatures. However, larger swim spas have dual-zone” heating; the primary section for the workouts is cold, while the second one for relaxing is hot. The time-tested performance, attractive appearance and obvious quality is apparent to everyone desiring a no-hassle cover lift.</p>
<p>Keep young children away from spas or hot tubs unless there is constant adult supervision. The food coloring will not damage any of the components in your hot tub, but you will have to drain it afterwards and refill it with fresh water.

There is a new invention called a Fast Lane Swim Jet unit that can be been retrofitted into most existing swimming pools.</p>
