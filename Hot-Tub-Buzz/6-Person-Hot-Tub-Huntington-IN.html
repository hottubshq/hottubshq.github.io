<p>OK, class ~ it's time to define the true meaning of the different types of hot water therapy. It has the new River Jet swim system with Viper pumps, and plenty of water features. Whisper-quiet motors, colorful lighting, dancing air bubbles, powerful jets — your bath is an expression of yourself and an extension of how you want to feel. Most indoor kinds hold one or two people simply because the available space is limited to the standard size bathroom. Similar to a regular bathtub you would see in a home, these hot tubs, sometimes called whirlpool baths or Jacuzzis, are filled with water for each use than drained when your soaking is complete.</p>
<p>It can be difficult to carve out the time you need to focus on your fitness, health, and family. The modular design also allows for pools of varying sizes from 7′ x 12′ to 10′ x 16′ with water depths up to 6′ deep. The idea behind the Jacuzzi tub is to bring the great features of an outdoor hot tub inside. Jacuzzi® J-400 hot tubs come in a variety of configurations including smaller 2-3 person tubs and a large 8-9 person hot tub.</p>
<p>Also, our Jacuzzi bathtub is designed using topmost grade material and progressive technology in conformity with latest market trends.

Jacuzzi tub brings the health benifits too. Swim spas provide space for kids to move around. Adding to Jacuzzi's fabulous range of therapy tubs and installation types are its innovative technologies.</p>

<p>This flexibility has allowed thousands of people to realize the dream of "endless" swimming at their own home.
