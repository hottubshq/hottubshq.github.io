<p>Hot tub pumps keep the massage jets powered and also help keep the water clean by circulating the water. A big expensive of a hot tub is the time and cost of manufacturing the actual hot tub shell, many of these are make from acrylic and fibre glass, but there are now a new and much cheaper way of manufacturing a hot tub shell by using rotational moulding, this is a much quicker process and therefore being down the manufacturing costs of hot tubs, therefore manufactures can sell cheap hot tubs Even thought these hot tub are cheap they still using the same quality parts as the expensive manufactures put in there hot tubs.</p>
<p>Swim spas definitely are not cheap, but they are about half the price of a nice pool.

Jacuzzi is the company that brought hydrotherapy to the market more than 50 years ago with their hot tubs, and it is clear they are the leading experts in the industry.</p>
<p>If you are planning to heat your swim spa for some or all of the year the best way to do this is with a heat pump which can heat (and potentially cool) your spa - providing total control over the water temperature for under $10 a week. It's important to note that some insurance providers simply won't cover you with the additional risk that a hot tub introduces. We recommend that you consult a plumber to calculate precisely what size water heater you'll need for a walk-in tub so you won't shortchange the rest of your household while bathing.</p>
