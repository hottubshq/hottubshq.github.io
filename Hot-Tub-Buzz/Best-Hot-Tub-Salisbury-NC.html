<p>Hydrotherapy and Jacuzzi hot tubs seem to go hand and hand these days. The comfort features in a Jacuzzi walk-in tub enhance the benefits of passive heating. This is absolutely vital if the shell of the swim spa is to last the lifetime of ownership. We are offering Claw Foot Bath Tubto our client and our product is made of good quality. Coast Spas® has partnered with Owens Corning® to Deliver the Toughest and Most Durable Hot Tub Shells Available. Many manufacturers design modern hut tubs and whirlpools to fit in most of the narrow bathrooms that still use small old tubs.</p>
<p>Swim spas definitely are not cheap, but they are about half the price of a nice pool. In pools, you worry about turns, running into the wall, or jumping too deep that you hit the ground, swim spas erase these concerns and the possibility of these incidents. Jacuzzi is the company that brought hydrotherapy to the market more than 50 years ago with their hot tubs, and it is clear they are the leading experts in the industry.</p>
<p>Hot tubs produce extreme heat as well as high humidity so your hot tub needs to be placed in a well ventilated area of your home. The two main types of swim spas - single zone” swim spas with one large swim area, and dual zone” swim spas - with separate spa and swim areas to allow you to have a different temperature in your spa and pool. Contact us today at 831-394-2222 to find out how quickly you can have a hot tub or swim spa added to your property.</p>
