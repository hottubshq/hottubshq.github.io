<p>We all know that buying hot tubs isn't a joke. It's also possible that you might be wanting to build a permanent hydrotherapy pool maybe as an addition to your own pool in your garden in which case this would be referred to as a spa. Swim spas usually only have seating at one end with 2 or 4 powerful swim jets at the other. If you're thinking about investing in a swim spa, you're probably interested in its health and exercise benefits. The water is hot and the jets are powerful which I find amazing for a 110 V appliance.</p>
<p>The 150mm swim jets create a current strong enough to swim against. If you want a little more versatility from your hot tub then swim spas are also a popular choice for gardens. Hot tubs are also designed for more than one person, so soaking can be a great opportunity to spend some time with your partner or friends. Vortex Swim Spas are the perfect centre point of any party. The most common type of tub is the Jacuzzi drop in tub For installation, these tubs are simply lowered into a framed enclosure, and they also include Jacuzzi's largest variety of available sizes and shapes.</p>
<p>The whirlpool bath was invented in the early 1940s by Candidi Jacuzzi, a second generation Jacuzzi. It's like a hot tub - but with even more benefits. Lay-Z-Spa makes a third entry onto our list with the Monaco hot tub. These little creatures can rapidly grow their colonies, especially in hot tubs that are not well maintained, and those that do not have periodic cleaning of the water. At Master Spas, we make buying a swim spa just as relaxing as owning one.</p>

<p>You are probably thinking, Yeah, this sounds great, but it probably costs like a trillion dollars.” That is a common misconception about Swim Spas…that they are only for the fabulously wealthy. Illumatherapy also offers four points of entry, with two on each side of the tub, and air bubbles spraying from the jets give the appearance of dancing as they reflect the light.

The best swim spas are designed so you swim in place against a current, rather than swimming traditional lengths in a pool.</p>
