<p>Today, hot tubs are more popular than ever and the number of hot tub owners is steadily rising. Muscle pain and stiffness cannot remain in your body when the hot, high speed water surrounds you. Most of the hot tubs on Wayfair require a water and electrical source, but if neither are viable in the area where you plan to place your hot tub, a popup hot tub might make more sense. After a swimming work-out you can relax in the spa zone and choose from a lounger seat, a neck and shoulder massage seat, 2 back massage seats or the frequently used cool down seat.</p>
<p>Fully adjustable current for swimming in place so you can focus on your form and never have to turn or push off a wall again.
