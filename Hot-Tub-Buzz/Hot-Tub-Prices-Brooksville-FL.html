<p>Not everyone can afford to pay $5,000 (or more) for a hot tub. The water in NSPs is 100 percent free from chemicals making it very desirable for swimming. Endless Pools has only a few accessories for sale, although it does sell underwater exercise equipment. Not only are high-quality spas luxurious and comfortable, they give you the opportunity to utilize energy-efficient technology and insulation. The best hot tub in 2018 can be enjoyed year-round and should seamlessly slip into your life like you plan to slip into a warm, jet-filled jacuzzi.</p>
<p>With the burgeoning interest in health and leisure across the United States, yet another opportunity was spotted in the 1960s, by Roy Jacuzzi, who invented and marketed the first self-contained, fully-integrated whirlpool bath, creating a whole new industry almost on his own. In short, hot tubs and Jacuzzis are not the same. Tests have proven that through having a heat pump within your spa pool or swim spa, running costs are reduced by over 50%, resulting in shortened and achievable payback period.</p>
<p>A question we see often is, "How much do swim spas cost?" While there are many different price points to fit a wide range of budgets, it's important to note that a typical swim spa costs half that of a traditional swimming pool. Some hot tubs can be as hot as 40C, so it's best to avoid them. But the first thing to consider when choosing your hot tubs would be the location. Hot tubs today are used to alleviate stress and aid sleep.</p>

Aquatic Circuit Training in a swimspa increases your aerobic and strength levels and burns more calories than other forms of exercise.</p>
<p>In the pool most people simply swim lengths and you can choose whether to swim for a set amount of time, or a number of lengths. Hot tubs must always ALWAYS be kept clean. Sitting in a sauna bath increases skin temperature, causes the pulse rate to double, and thus, increases blood circulation. Today, Jacuzzi features an expanded luxury tub environment, with four types of therapeutic tubs. Our hot tubs are extremely durable, but should anything go wrong, you won't be left high and dry.</p>
