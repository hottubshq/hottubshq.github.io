<p>A dip in the warm water of a hot tub can help to soothe tight, sore muscles, and ending a date in the Jacuzzi might allow couples to relax and share intimate time in a whole new way. It has separate temperature controls for the swimming lane and hot tub which means that someone can be comfortably practicing their stroke at a swimming pool temperature while others can be seated in warmer waters in the hot tub area. Unlike pools, you can change the current intensity to suit any swimming level you desire. Hot tub accidents or injuries for home residents are not covered; that falls under your health insurance plan.</p>
<p>The difference with swim spas is that they're often larger than a standard spa pool and have an open area at one end without seating. If an Extreme Lighting Package is installed on your spa, each corner will light up to match the color of light in your hot tub. When you allow the massaging jets to massage your sore spots or even just hold your feet up to the circulating massaging water you will immediately feel better and your feet won't hurt much at all.</p>
<p>As a different alternative to an above ground swim spa, you could consider a Little Pool These are smaller versions of full-sized fibreglass swimming pools, made to the same high standards, but they are portable, easy to install, and instant to use. Jacuzzi still to this day continues to innovate & lead the hot tub industry forward. One of the most overlooked areas in a swimspa is the ability of the unit to provide benefits outside the swim and massage.</p>
