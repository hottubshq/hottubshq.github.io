<p>Of course, every Endless Pools Fitness System is so much more than a spa. Most of the hot tubs especially cheap imports from the east of the world are created using cheap methods, from people that probably have no expertise in the trade and are just following regular instructions from there team managers.

But it's so easy to drop a glass” made of glass and have it shatter on the way to the tub or once you're soaking. Hot tubs are usually heated using an electric or natural gas heater, though there are also submersible wood fire hot tub heaters, as well as solar hot water systems. This includes a self-cleaning option and an independent heater so your water heater does not take such a beating every time it tries to fill up the tub.</p>
