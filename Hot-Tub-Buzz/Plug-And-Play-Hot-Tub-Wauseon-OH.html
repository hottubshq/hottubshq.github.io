<p>You will find that there are many manufacturers of bath tubs on the market today but only one name really stands above the rest. Jacuzzi Water Villas are water bungalows in the Maldives, located over-the-water, in the lagoon… a short walk along your private jetty to this secluded hideaway featuring a larger bedroom, wood floor, espresso machine, a spacious bathroom, a private walled-in outdoor area featuring a Jacuzzi for two under the stars”, a wooden sundeck with chaise lounges, a shaded area, tropical plants, a private sundeck with stairs into the sea and the most magnificent views of all.</p>
<p>And some hot tubs have too high a level of chemicals. Buoyancy-simulating Levitator Jets are angled upwards toward the swimmer to replicate the natural buoyancy that would be present as you swim in open water. The wooden tub looks a bit like an oversized wine barrel and needs a permanent platform to stand on. The wooden spa is heated by fire, is better outside and needs a fair bit of maintenance to keep it in good working order.</p>
<p>Designed with luxury and fitness training in mind, we're thrilled to carry the entire HydroPool swim spa line, one of the easiest swim spas in the world to maintain. The pricing on Jacuzzi bathtubs changes rapidly depending on the features the tubs offer.
