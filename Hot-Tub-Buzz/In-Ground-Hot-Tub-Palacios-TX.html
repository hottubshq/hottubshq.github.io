<p>That wonderful feeling you get whenever you sit back in a hot tub is because of the way your body reacts to the heat and jets of water. Jacuzzi® is the name that defines the hot tub experience. Our product range includes Steam Bath Unit, Sauna Bath Unit, Shower Enclosure, Bath Tubs, Jacuzzi Systems, Spa Product, Bathroom Accessories and similar other products. The spa tubs have a purification system attached to it. This system ensures that the water that enters the tub is cleaned of all contaminants. You want to be in your tub, not taking a bunch of time to maintain it. That's why Rich's has carried Leisure Time, the premier name in hot tub water care for over twenty-five years.</p>
<p>Gleaning all of the information that you can, you've thoroughly researched your options for hot tubs, spas and Jacuzzis. In-ground hot tubs may come with different rules and limitations. Away from hydrotherapy, the vast range of Jacuzzi® hot tubs ensures cutting edge technology from advanced filtration to water purification and much more all encased in aesthetically pleasing designs which provide a fantastic look in both indoor and outdoor environments including the garden or terrace.</p>

I have to say that this does sound pretty appealing but my suspicion is that they aren't all that comfortable and I would miss the luxury of the moving water and hydrotherapy aspects of the modern hot tub.</p>
