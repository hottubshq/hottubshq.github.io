The food coloring will not damage any of the components in your hot tub, but you will have to drain it afterwards and refill it with fresh water.

While technically Jacuzzi is a proper and brand name, when people use the word jacuzzi, they are referring to a standard hot tub.</p>
<p>One of the biggest benefits of a swim spa is that it can be used 365 days a year. One downside is that you cannot use bubble bath, bath oil or bath salts in a jetted tub with water jets.
