<p>Spas and Hot tubs have enjoyed huge popularity of the last few years. This is a spa that is offered at a fitness club or a recreational club as an added facility. Unlike a swimming pool which can be quite costly to install and requires a large backyard, swim spas offer this all-in-one portable package in a box that can be craned into position in an hour. If you plan to heat your swim spa regularly, especially the swim end due to the large amount of water, you need to be able to use a gas or a heat pump as the electric heaters will be very expensive.</p>
<p>The Swim Collection is available in a Pool, Play, Performance, Wellness Spa® and Wellness Spa®X Series. EBay, the king of online auctions, typically has dozens of hot tub auctions running at any one time. It is a known fact that warm water helps not only to reduce stress, but also to ease sore muscles and aches. Completely adjustable current means everyone who uses the swim spa will find the perfect swimming speed.</p>
<p>The water resistance available at swim spas can help you in burning more calories than doing the same workout on drylands, losing weight and fat mass, and improving your fitness level. As already mentioned, in addition to the standard equipment, hot tubs can be equipped with extra accessories like the devices for chromotherapy and aromatherapy. These are super-strong fibreglass pools with ceramic cores, manufactured to the very highest standards using the latest in swimming pool technology.</p>
