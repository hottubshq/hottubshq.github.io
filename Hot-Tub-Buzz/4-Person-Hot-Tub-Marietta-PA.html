<p>That can easily occur if you spend more than 10 minutes in a hot tub with a water temperature of 104°F (40°C). The only trick is that you should make sure that you are choosing direct swim spas.

<p>This flexibility has allowed thousands of people to realize the dream of "endless" swimming at their own home. Quite simply, a Swim Spa is a machine that allows you to swim continuously against a water current.

<p>We introduce ourselves as eminent manufacturer, supplier, retailer & trader of Jacuzzi Bathtub with DVD. Their professionalism, customer service, commitment to their spa pools and ultimately the customer satisfaction is such a rarity. Swim spas have most of the benefits of a swimming pool but can be installed into a smaller space and are much cheaper.
