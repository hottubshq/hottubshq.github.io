This bathtub exceeded my expectations. They say that swimmers are more prone to dehydration because it causes high levels of exertion in the body, but swimmers do not feel the urge to drink because they are immersed within the water and therefore the brain is not aware of the need for water, and other liquids.</p>
<p>Some of our swim spas have seating along the sides of the spa as well like myLapswim This gives more room for people to sit and enjoy a massage but reduces the pool area at the swim jet end.

<p>Swim spas and spa pools (also known as portable spas or hot tubs) are very similar.
