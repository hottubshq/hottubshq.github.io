<p>You walk out to use your spa or hot tub and immediately you know something is wrong. Specialty treatments at Hot Springs Resort and Spa are a true experience in decadence.

<p>Welcome to TidalFit — the answer to swimming, aquatic fitness and soothing massage in one. During this time, I continued to watch the growth and increase in popularity of free standing, self-contained swim spas, however, the quality and performance of these spas simply did not meet my standards and expectations.

Also, hot tubs are pretty easy to maintain, which is what you need if it is going to be something you want to relax in. Especially if you consider it against getting something like a swimming pool which is going to take up a lot of space and be high maintenance.</p>
<p>The reason most people opt for a swim spa is that they don't have enough room for a full-sized swimming pool. The swimming part of a swim spa is what makes it uniquely different than a hot tub alone, however. Always make certain the spa's control system accommodates the heat pump. And if you're interested in swimming laps without installing a massive pool, swim spas are a great alternative. As we evaluated them, we considered their current systems and the types of jets they offer as well as their customer service, selection, prices and accessories.</p>
<p>In 1956, the Jacuzzi family created a portable hydrotherapy pump to help treat a family member's painful arthritis. This creates a stronger massage than tubs with the air jets.

Swim spas are flexible, durable and practical. In just a few years' time, Jacuzzi became a household name and was quickly used to refer to any and all hot tubs, however incorrectly.</p>
