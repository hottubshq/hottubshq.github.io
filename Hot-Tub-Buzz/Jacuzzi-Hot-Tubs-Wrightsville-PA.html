<p>Did you know that a swimming pool is not only fun to swim and relax in? Aside from the consideration of a spa's heat pump, the insulation within a spa pool determines how much output energy is required to maintain it. There are three main insulation systems used today, it is dependable on the company, manufacturer and model as to which one is adopted. The TruSwim® unique dual propulsion design guarantees an incomparable aquatic fitness experience with endless possibilities. We have been researching, ranking and reviewing swim spas for more than four years.</p>
<p>Depending on the level of luxury you're going for you can get hot tubs with different jet speeds, mood lighting and even built in sound systems so you can really make the most of your outdoor space. This acrylic bathtub is extensively used at homes, hotels and many other places. On average, a Jacuzzi tub weighs 700 Lbs, and once you add water and your body weight into the equation, the entire setup can weigh up to 1,000 Lbs.</p>
<p>Bathroom was spacious and the tub was a nice feature. Like cars, not all swim spas are alike. You could also purchase the Jacuzzi Bath Tubs that have the model number of BA06. Single zone swim spas with 2 or 3 jet pumps require a 32 amp direct wired power supply (and isolation switch) and dual zone and professional swim spas require up to 60 amps (dual zone swim spas will supply two separate power supplies). A jet system creates a smooth current of water ideal for fitness activities, and massage jets offer relief from stress, aches, and muscle pain.</p>
