<p>The Balboa Water Group is widely known for its lines of equipment, accessories and control system for the leisure water industry. If your hot tub is freestanding, you will need to provide steps so that people can climb into the tub and step onto the seating area. While there are many similarities between an exercise spa, lap pool and swim spa, securing a great deal comes from understanding exactly what you are looking for and why. We provide this Jacuzzi bathtub on several designs & other related options as per the needs of customers.</p>
