<p>That wonderful feeling you get whenever you sit back in a hot tub is because of the way your body reacts to the heat and jets of water. High-end swim spas are also generally larger than mid-range swim spas and include added hydrotherapy and fitness options that aren't found in other swim spas. The Jacuzzi Fast Drain technology drains the water in half the time it takes a standard tub to empty, which is a plus for your comfort while you wait to be able open the door. Come see our large selection of pre-owned hot tubs. Just think of it. Your whole body soaked in hot water, your back and legs and arms being gently massaged by sensual jets of water, with soothing bubbles all around, and feelings of peace and tranquility taking over your body as you close your eyes and start to dream and look back at the kind of day it's been.</p>
<p>When you put Jacuzzi® Pro Grade Pool Equipment in your backyard, you trust its performance. Jacuzzi Pure Air tubs range from a bubbly champagne-like experience to a steadier stream of bubbles, depending entirely on the setting chosen by the user. Typically swim spas are generally about 12 to 24 feet in length. Taking a bath in the Spa Jacuzzi bathtub is a great way to enjoy and release stress after a long day at work.</p>
<p>A question we see often is, "How much do swim spas cost?" While there are many different price points to fit a wide range of budgets, it's important to note that a typical swim spa costs half that of a traditional swimming pool. Some hot tubs can be as hot as 40C, so it's best to avoid them. But the first thing to consider when choosing your hot tubs would be the location. Hot tubs today are used to alleviate stress and aid sleep.</p>

Quite simply, a Swim Spa is a machine that allows you to swim continuously against a water current.

<p>We are offering Jacuzzi Whirlpool Bathtubto our client and our product is made of good quality. Another primary reason many homeowners are now opting for indoor hot tubs rather than outside is the weather. These X-Series models stand out from typical jetted options because the four swim jets are air-free and produce a no-turbulence current. Quality spa heaters are always placed within a marine grade stainless steel tube.</p>
<p>This is also how hot tubs take away stress. Hot tubs are unlike saunas, steam- and Turkish baths, which are steam only. You can easily assemble a swim spa together and use it as a portable swimming pool, wherever you go. Positioned to hit your shoulders and torso (jets that are too far apart or too low will not create the required resistance against the body and are a waste of water flow). Spas should also have a diverter valve to maintain water pressure on 1 or 2 seats.</p>
