<p>Even though swim spas are hugely beneficial from a health and wellness perspective, they suffer from one major drawback. Swim spas are not an ideal choice for families, as only one person can comfortably swim in a swim spa at any time. The Jacuzzi brand tradition of innovation in hydro-massage has made Jacuzzi the most desired product in whirlpool bathing. Our spas come with valuable customer and technical support for the lifetime of the spa. Visit Jacuzzi Hot Tubs and Outdoor Living to discover all the ways you can benefit from the high standards and the low maintenance offered by a HydroPool.</p>
<p>As time progressed though, the average price of a portable hot tub spa shot way up, mostly because of all the new features and advanced technology that was being built into them. The reason for this is because this elongated part is the swimming pool part. If your Jacuzzi bathtub comes with a built-in filtration and water purification system, maintaining your hot tub should be a breeze.

<p>The deep penetrating moist heat relaxes the muscles and expands the blood vessels, creating a sedative effect on the nervous system. Hydrotherapy in a hot tub provides relief for high blood pressure because it dilates or opens up blood vessels so the heart doesn't have to pump as hard.

<p>As swim spas are usually purchased by people with limited space, the average models are quite small compared to a full sized pool. Overall, considering the amount of features a swim spa has, it does offer good value, making it an attractive option, particularly if you are on a budget. Endless Pools is one of the first companies to develop this Swim Spa, or endless” swimming pool concept quite a number of years ago.</p>
