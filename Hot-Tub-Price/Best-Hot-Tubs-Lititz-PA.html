Add warmth and water movement and hot tubbing becomes the stuff of lifetime memories. If you do use a hot tub, turn down the temperature and limit your time in the water to less than 10 minutes. A Spa system will use air to push the water around your bath and create that bubble and whirl effects.</p>

By having a smaller tub the volume of water is a lot less therefore running cost are reduced due to the heater having less water to heat.</p>
