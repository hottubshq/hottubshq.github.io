<p>The idea is that you swim in the tub and the current produced by the swim spa pushes against you in much the same way as a treadmill. Putting one on the second floor is not a good idea, unless it is a small bathtub Jacuzzi. Our insulation system harnesses all the heat from the pumps and the heater inside the spa cabinet while reflecting the colder outside air away from the spa. This is why we make Royal Spa Swim Spas from components that can be found at most pool and spa supply stores.</p>
