<p>In our modern, high-tech society, everything gets reviewed these days. As you are swimming in the sea you should not try to work harder than you would in a regular pool. Hot tubs are usually located outdoors, although they can be installed indoors. This is a patented technology; hence, you will not find this technology in any other ordinary swim spas. Using heat and the element of massage, Healthy Living Hot Tubs create one-of-a-kind hydrotherapy to ease aches and pain, calm stress and boost the natural healing response.</p>
<p>The difference with swim spas is that they're often larger than a standard spa pool and have an open area at one end without seating. If an Extreme Lighting Package is installed on your spa, each corner will light up to match the color of light in your hot tub. When you allow the massaging jets to massage your sore spots or even just hold your feet up to the circulating massaging water you will immediately feel better and your feet won't hurt much at all.</p>
<p>Just like hot tub spas, most Swim Spas are molded out of acrylic and are typically 12′ - 24′ in length. The unique shell design of the MP line of swim spas gives you a long and wide swim area with no hidden obstacles like benches or steps to hit your feet. Avoid hot tubs if you can during those 9 months. If you are looking for a free-standing pool with heated water, hydrotherapy jets, filtration system and one that is semi-permanent then a hot tub is what you need.</p>
<h2>Local Hot Tubs Colchester Connecticut</h2>

The exercise capabilities of a pool and the therapy of a hot tub, you get the best of both worlds in the Swim Spa 1200. Fill the tub with water hot enough to make you sweat. 8 people - comfortable ergonomic seating with full body hydrotherapy jets in the back and bench seats on each side.

<p>Swimming in a swim spa adds extra benefits. That is why if you notice, the jets are usually positioned at the most stressed muscles of the body - the calves, neck, some at the back, and at the sole of the feet. We favored those that sell spas with paddlewheel current systems, since they're usually the strongest. The bath water is recirculated through the jets, which keeps the water a bit warmer than air being forced in the bath.</p>
<h3>Endless Swim Spas Colchester</h3>
<p>Spa resorts (including natural hot springs) typically offer various forms of hydrotherapy. We also carry replacement Jacuzzi® bathtub parts to help maintain optimal performance in your home spa. Hot tubs, unlike the whirlpool baths, could be used outside with this heating system. If you have been thinking about trying out a hot tub but don't want to splash too much cash, then users have said great things about this basic spa from Tesco.</p>
<p>Our new jetted swim current lets you exercise with gentle resistance, and then unwind in ergonomically sculpted hydromassage seats. The photo to the left shows the hot tub spa area of an all-in-one Swim Spa unit. You don't need to have the jets or blowers on - there is nothing like laying in your own hot tub, with just your head poking out of the water, watching the sun go down. With a swim spa at home, the incredible benefits of aquatic fitness are delivered right to your doorstep—no traveling, monthly gym membership or navigating a crowded pool filled with strangers.</p>
<p>You can use a smartphone app to run your swim spa from afar, opt for a speaker system and even a fancy cover to protect your investment. Hot tubs are also found at natural hot springs ; in this case, the water may be dangerously hot and must be combined with cool water for a safe soaking temperature. These days, Jacuzzi employs nearly 5,000 people worldwide and has become the name we most associate with whirlpool baths.</p>
