<p>Hydrotherapy and Jacuzzi hot tubs seem to go hand and hand these days. The comfort features in a Jacuzzi walk-in tub enhance the benefits of passive heating. This is absolutely vital if the shell of the swim spa is to last the lifetime of ownership. We are offering Claw Foot Bath Tubto our client and our product is made of good quality. Coast Spas® has partnered with Owens Corning® to Deliver the Toughest and Most Durable Hot Tub Shells Available. Many manufacturers design modern hut tubs and whirlpools to fit in most of the narrow bathrooms that still use small old tubs.</p>
<p>It's an inflatable jacuzzi so you can still get a good deal on it, and it holds up to six people and more water than most: up to 290Gal (1097L). Although the swim spa can be used as a fitness platform, there are also a number of other benefits, such as the efficiency and portability that you can get over a full blown swimming pool. Each hot tub is master crafted to achieve enhanced, innovative therapy and high tech advancements in construction, performance, insulation, filtration and heating systems.</p>
<p>Jets are located around the sides of the tub and air injectors are located under the seats. For example, it's easy to see you need to buy a Synergy or a TruSwim swim spa if you want cascading water spouts, not a Vitality model. It lets you swim, exercise, play, and entertain; it's the perfect fun-and-fitness solution for family, friends, and solo retreats. Built tough for the great Aussie outdoors, your spa pool or swim spa will last, backed by our lifetime care commitment.</p>
