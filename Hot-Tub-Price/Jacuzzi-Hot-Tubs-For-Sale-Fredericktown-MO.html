If you want to heat your swim spa at all you need to consider buying a dual zone swim spa so you can use the electric heater(s) to affordably heat just the spa end only and take the edge off” the temperature in the swim end.

<p>As its name suggests, a swim spa pool is basically a cross between a spa and a swimming pool. But even with limited space, a larger swim spa is still much smaller than a full pool while providing a comfortable experience for a decent number of people. When most people go to buy the spas, the first question they have in mind is the cost and the second question is about the power consumption. Swim Spas actually cost a bit more than a portable hot tub spa and a lot less than an inground swimming pool.</p>

<p>If you are looking to have a swimming pool and hot tub combination, a two tank swim spa might be your best option. Swim spas require a solid, level surface to sit on and an electrical supply line (usually 220 volt, similar to a hot tub). We believe the best way to deliver great service is to represent the number 1 hot tub brand in the world - Jacuzzi. In fact, some studies suggest aquatic exercise may be more effective than on-land workouts for some people with back ailments, according to an article by Rena Goldman in Pool & Spa News Like with osteoarthritis and bone and joints ailments, the secret here lies in the reduction of pressure on your joints provided by the buoyancy of the water.</p>
<p>The Viton seal material is said to be more impervious to chemical wear from chlorine, bromine, ozone and other hot tub water treatments. Bromine also performs a little better in hot water of a spa. This, in fact, is not far from being accurate in that lower end hot tubs are available for between $2000 and $4000. We are offering Double seater jacuzzi Bath Tubto our client and our product is made of good quality.</p>
<p>For this reason, it is now mandatory on public swimming pools in many states in the US. However, a swim spa can be a great addition to your backyard, as it offers the dual benefits of swimming and the spa experience on your own property. If your swim spa is not insulated or if you have lower-powered pumps, you might end up wasting money on high water and electric bills. The average swim spa weighs 3,000 pounds before adding a drop of water, and measures roughly 52 inches high.</p>
<p>Sure, if your bathroom is too small for a hot tub, or any tub for that matter, you could always choose a massage shower. Install fencing or invest in a sturdy cover that kids can't fall though, even if they step on it. Also, pull up or remove ladders from above-ground models when not in use to prevent children from climbing into the pool or hot tub. An H2X Fitness Swim Spa allows you to exercise, relax, and entertain in the convenience and privacy of your backyard, year-round.</p>
