You can find more in-depth information on the benefits of whirlpool baths and discover whether a whirlpool bath is the right choice for you. As the Jacuzzi brand became more famous, people started referring to a hot tub as a jacuzzi.

<p>Product offerings include whirlpool baths, outdoor hot tubs, showers, sanitary ware, bath tubs, as well as fixtures and accessories. Allow the water to drop and keep a close eye on it. Turn off the jets and slowly let the water drop in the tub. A perfect example of the confusion that exists: a hot tub, to me, is not a spa, and it's certainly not a Jacuzzi. Jacuzzi keeps things simple by only offering two walk-in tub lines: the Jacuzzi Walk-In Tub and the Finestra Bathtub.</p>
