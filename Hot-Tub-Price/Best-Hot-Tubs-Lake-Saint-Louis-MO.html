Jacuzzi tub is the hot tub which experienced you fun and relaxing and leaves you wanting more. These public swimming pools are generally found as section of a bigger leisure complex or recreational center. Swimming is one of the best methods of building your body's strength and muscle toning, and owning your own swim spa allows you to swim every day without the hassle and running costs of a large, traditional swimming pool, or the expense and effort of visiting a public pool or gym.</p>
<p>Endless Pools was one of the first companies to develop the Swim Spa concept years ago. By taking the added stress of maintenance, repairs and replacement out of owning a hot tub, Jacuzzi for Life provides customers in Hamilton, Burlington and surrounding areas with the best experience available on the market.

<p>Swimlife is in the swimspa business for life and the only way to ensure success is to produce, offer and innovate the highest quality swimspas possible.

By reducing the temperature drop required before the heater switches on, Reactive Heater Control provides more consistent spa water temperatures and lowers your daily operating costs.</p>
<p>Ensure the spa you are buying has Ozone, paired with a mixing chamber, as well as UV. If you decide on a spa pool with a salt-water sanitising system, ensure you understand the details of its functioning and upkeep prior to purchase.

<p>Hot water is a great way to keep the body moving. A Jacuzzi soaking tub is the most common type of tub, and this basic concept is Jacuzzi's foundation for hydrotherapy tubs. Some hot tubs also come with features that Jacuzzi products do not, such as flat-screen TVs and built-in MP3 audio systems. Our Swim Spa River Jets are each powered solely by a 4 HP (6BHP) Hyper Flow Jet Pump. Having the swim spa completely above ground is another option that allows you to fence only the steps (as long as the swim spa is over 1200mm high the height of pool fencing).</p>
