<p>Hot tubs are a great way to relax after a long day at work. If you want an inground swim spa installed, you can expect to pay more than these prices, as there is so much extra work involved in installing any pool inground. In many areas you can also commission hot tubs and install wooden swimming pools. Quarrycast is a mineral crystal composite, a new material developed by Victoria & Albert Baths, to enhance your bathing experience: it's warm to the touch, keeping the water in your hot tub hot for a long time; it has a naturally high gloss finish and it can be colored with the dye of your choice, maximizing the interior design options in your bathroom.</p>
<p>The drastic price difference while having the same benefits give swim spas an advantage over the other options. There are Hot tub on the marketplace now that are designed for two people only; therefore the tubs are much smaller to the traditional larger hot tubs. These smaller sized swim spas can still accommodate several bathers, although if you're taller than average it might feel a little small. Another great characteristic that comes with owning a swim spa is that its maintenance is so much easier then it would be with owning a swimming pool.</p>
<p>If you are planning to heat your swim spa for some or all of the year the best way to do this is with a heat pump which can heat (and potentially cool) your spa - providing total control over the water temperature for under $10 a week. It's important to note that some insurance providers simply won't cover you with the additional risk that a hot tub introduces. We recommend that you consult a plumber to calculate precisely what size water heater you'll need for a walk-in tub so you won't shortchange the rest of your household while bathing.</p>

<p>Other things to consider when thinking about adding a spa to your home are things like where is the water supply coming from, how heavy will it be and can it be supported, and also you need to take into consideration how many people may be using it. Now although you will probably have a fitter work everything out for you, make sure you question the plans as regards to any electrics and water supplies, so that you are clear in your own head that what they are suggesting can not only be implemented, but are also safe.</p>
<p>For best results, we recommend that you clean your whirlpool bathtub after each use. Both offer jets optimized for massage and both models allow for full body soaks.

Yes, our swim spas come is a variety of sizes. When purchasing your spa pool, we urge you to ensure the spas shell construction follows the above details.

<p>Legendary for performance, reliability, and ease of use, they set the standard by which all hot tubs are measured.

In general, for swim spas the base must be able to support 1000kg per square metre and this requires a level slab that is 50mm (6”) minimum thickness with F72 reinforcing mesh. Our wide selection of hot tubs includes a variety of choices from industry leading manufacturers including HotSprings and Caldera.</p>
<p>Over the past 2 years we've been helping customers with swim spas determine the best care program for their individual needs and addressing their individual concerns. The length of your swim spa area should be the height of the tallest swimmer in your household with their arms outstretched plus around a metre so you don't touch the jets or kick the seats while swimming. The health benefits from increased circulation and such that you get from the water jets you do not get with an air jetted bathtub.</p>
<p>Many different styles of corner tubs are available, including taller and deeper tubs (much like soaking tubs) give you a full body bath in a quarter of the space (length x width), and it utilizes the often ample space in height in many bathrooms. Swim spas are extremely easy and convenient when it comes to their use, cleaning, and installing. You should always check that all the pumps and blowers are working and that the heater control lights indicate that the heater is on when the spa is calling for heat.</p>
