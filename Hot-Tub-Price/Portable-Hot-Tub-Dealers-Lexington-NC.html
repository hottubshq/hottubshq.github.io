<p>We all know that buying hot tubs isn't a joke. It's also possible that you might be wanting to build a permanent hydrotherapy pool maybe as an addition to your own pool in your garden in which case this would be referred to as a spa. Swim spas usually only have seating at one end with 2 or 4 powerful swim jets at the other. If you're thinking about investing in a swim spa, you're probably interested in its health and exercise benefits. The water is hot and the jets are powerful which I find amazing for a 110 V appliance.</p>
<p>A good way to locate leaks in your hot tub is by using food coloring and by adding it to the water. Swim Spas are the professional athlete's choice when selecting a swimming pool, and can form an important part of the day-to-day fitness regime of anyone who wants to stay in good shape. Chemicals used to clean and disinfect hot tubs may cause allergic reactions in some people. With three airless swim jets, seating for the family, spa seats with 27 hydromassage jets and plenty of room to move, the R120 sets a new benchmark for quality and value.</p>
<p>As a different alternative to an above ground swim spa, you could consider a Little Pool These are smaller versions of full-sized fibreglass swimming pools, made to the same high standards, but they are portable, easy to install, and instant to use. Jacuzzi still to this day continues to innovate & lead the hot tub industry forward. One of the most overlooked areas in a swimspa is the ability of the unit to provide benefits outside the swim and massage.</p>

<p>They find SwimLife swimspas the ultimate answer to satify all their needs and answer the demand for more for their money. SwimLife is all about changing how the industry sells and promotes swimspas. A sauna bath feels therapeutic, but may be a bit too warm for the testicles, and men who regularly spend time in hot tubs may have low fertility rates as a result. Cheaper spas sometimes reduce the size of the unit to make up for these cuts.</p>
<p>Raised push buttons also make operating the light, air, and whirlpool systems extremely easy. In the late 1960s, Roy Jacuzzi, a third-generation Jacuzzi toyed with the idea of marketing the pump-fitted bath tub dubbed the 'Roman Bathtub' to cater for the growing need for leisure. When Swim Spas first came on the market about 10 years ago, they were priced in the $25,000 range. By having a smaller tub the volume of water is a lot less therefore running cost are reduced due to the heater having less water to heat.</p>
