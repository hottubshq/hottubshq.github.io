<p>Even though swim spas are hugely beneficial from a health and wellness perspective, they suffer from one major drawback. Swim spas are not an ideal choice for families, as only one person can comfortably swim in a swim spa at any time. The Jacuzzi brand tradition of innovation in hydro-massage has made Jacuzzi the most desired product in whirlpool bathing. Our spas come with valuable customer and technical support for the lifetime of the spa. Visit Jacuzzi Hot Tubs and Outdoor Living to discover all the ways you can benefit from the high standards and the low maintenance offered by a HydroPool.</p>
<p>All of Jacuzzi® hot tubs comply with the California Energy Commission standards of energy efficiency. According to another article by the CDC, you should use pool test strips to check your spa water's pH and free chlorine or free bromine concentration. It seats up to 6 people with a whopping 35 jets including 5 hydro-massage seat jets for maximum luxury. A general rule of thumb is that the water heater should be no less than two-thirds the size of the water capacity of the tub.</p>
<p>As the overall exercise means that a person's whole body changes, so they become generally healthier and more compact with regular water-based exercise. If it doesn't say ” for hot tubs and spas” on the label, don't buy it. Every backyard, every budget and every customer can have a different definition of when the best time to buy a hot tub is. It is with this is mind, that I am writing this blog to help you to decide when the best time is for you to purchase is.</p>

<p>In terms of price, portable hot tubs are more affordable than regular hot tubs.

<h3>Hot Tubs & Saunas You'll Love In Lafayette</h3>
<p>A basic model costs about $4,000, while more expensive swim spas, complete with custom features, cost upward of $30,000. Jacuzzi's alcove tubs are installed into a three-wall tiled niche, as the side No. 4 is either a shower curtain or glass shower door.

<p>You are probably thinking, Yeah, this sounds great, but it probably costs like a trillion dollars.” That is a common misconception about Swim Spas…that they are only for the fabulously wealthy. Illumatherapy also offers four points of entry, with two on each side of the tub, and air bubbles spraying from the jets give the appearance of dancing as they reflect the light. The blowers make the hot tub feel like you've got your own personal geyser - forcing air from the bottom of the pool, and creating a very relaxing environment for you.</p>
<p>These same rules apply at residential spas, hot tubs and pools, too. Hot tub folliculitis is a type of skin infection on the hair follicles which is brought about by immersion in a hot tub with unclean water. If you break out in itchy spots after using a hot tub, you may have "hot tub rash." It's one of the more common illnesses linked to hot tubs , according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).</p>

<p>You should always have the cover on it when the tub is not in not only keeps the water warm but also keeps the dirt and dust out. Although the words hot tub” and spa” can refer to the same thing here in the U.S., many parts of the world use the word spa” to refer to natural mineral springs.

<p>Raised push buttons also make operating the light, air, and whirlpool systems extremely easy. In the late 1960s, Roy Jacuzzi, a third-generation Jacuzzi toyed with the idea of marketing the pump-fitted bath tub dubbed the 'Roman Bathtub' to cater for the growing need for leisure. When Swim Spas first came on the market about 10 years ago, they were priced in the $25,000 range. By having a smaller tub the volume of water is a lot less therefore running cost are reduced due to the heater having less water to heat.</p>
<p>The Hydrozone Plunge has no swim jets and two pumps. Our decision was based on expert knowledge, common sense advice regarding running costs, information about water cleanliness and about the necessary foundations for the product, delivery and set up and of course on the significant therapeutic benefits the spa will offer to my husband. Arctic Spas® has solutions for these valid concerns with our FreeHeat and Spa Boy® technology greatly lowering your monthly energy costs and to help maintain ideal spa conditions.</p>
