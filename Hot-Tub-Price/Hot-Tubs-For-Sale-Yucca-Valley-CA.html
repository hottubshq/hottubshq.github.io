<p>How to design for a Jacuzzi in your house. The Hydrozone Plunge has no swim jets and two pumps. Our decision was based on expert knowledge, common sense advice regarding running costs, information about water cleanliness and about the necessary foundations for the product, delivery and set up and of course on the significant therapeutic benefits the spa will offer to my husband. Arctic Spas® has solutions for these valid concerns with our FreeHeat and Spa Boy® technology greatly lowering your monthly energy costs and to help maintain ideal spa conditions.</p>
<p>With the burgeoning interest in health and leisure across the United States, yet another opportunity was spotted in the 1960s, by Roy Jacuzzi, who invented and marketed the first self-contained, fully-integrated whirlpool bath, creating a whole new industry almost on his own. In short, hot tubs and Jacuzzis are not the same. Tests have proven that through having a heat pump within your spa pool or swim spa, running costs are reduced by over 50%, resulting in shortened and achievable payback period.</p>
<p>The warm water inside the tub can relax spasms, alleviate sprains, backache, and fatigue. This allow you to run your heat pump from your spa controller (not via a separate touchpad), use both heat pump AND electric heater for extra fast heating and extends the life of the heat pump. The heat eases out the tension built up in the muscles and increases the blood flow, which in turn heals the body. With 60 years of experience in manufacturing and a legacy of quality products, you can trust that Jacuzzi® understands quality and is focused on customer satisfaction.</p>
