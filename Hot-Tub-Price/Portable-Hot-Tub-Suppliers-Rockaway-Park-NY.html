When your bathroom space is limited, a corner tub can give you the most out of the space. The next big leap forward came when the Jacuzzi brothers hydrotherapy pump was combined with fibreglass bodywork, a filtration system and electric heating system to create what is essentially the modern day hot tub.</p>
<p>The offered acrylic bathtub is designed from the best material & latest technology in accordance with the norms of market. This is even more important if you don't plan on using the bathtub again for several days. An electric heater can also be installed for enjoying hot whirling water in Jacuzzi.
