Jacuzzi Pure Air tubs offer the unique experience of a steady stream of bubbles that soothe the body. Hot tubs have no such current, but the water often swirls and bubbles around sitters as they relax.</p>
<p>Hot tubs produce extreme heat as well as high humidity so your hot tub needs to be placed in a well ventilated area of your home. The two main types of swim spas - single zone” swim spas with one large swim area, and dual zone” swim spas - with separate spa and swim areas to allow you to have a different temperature in your spa and pool.
