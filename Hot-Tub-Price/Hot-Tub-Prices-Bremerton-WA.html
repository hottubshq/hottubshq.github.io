<p>Jacuzzis are among the most popular addition to a luxury bathroom. The choice ranges from more classic wood-covered hot tubs, for a timeless elegance, to the most glamorous ones with faux leather covering, conceived to resist bed weather. There are hot tubs suitable for very small spaces and even unusual geometric designs. Swim spas, on the other hand, offer you the two options that you can choose from to suit the weather. Some of the features to look for in a swimspa that can provide this type of an experience are fitness related.</p>
<p>Enjoy the best of both worlds: a relaxing spa pool and water-based exercise swim spa in the comfort of your backyard.

<p>You can also find models that feature stunning LED light displays, gorgeous water features, touchscreen control panel, MOTO Massage Jets (the only full-back rotating jets in the entire hot tub market), Bluetooth compatible speaker systems, visual entertainment systems and so much more.

This allows a person, or pet, to soak in warm, relaxing water, while still swimming and exercising against a legitimate current and with plenty of space.
