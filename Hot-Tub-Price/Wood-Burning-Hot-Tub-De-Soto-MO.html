<p>Hot tubs and spas are becoming increasingly more popular and they are to be found in many homes. According to Wikipedia : a Hot Tub is a large tub or small pool full of heated water and used for hydrotherapy or pleasure. Add warmth and water movement and hot tubbing becomes the stuff of lifetime memories. If you do use a hot tub, turn down the temperature and limit your time in the water to less than 10 minutes. A Spa system will use air to push the water around your bath and create that bubble and whirl effects.</p>
<p>Induced air: The jets may use a venturi effect to incorporate air into the water stream for a lighter massage effect; this requires another set of hoses. I know that sounds obvious, but many people dont consider the consequences of putting a hot tub inside the house, upstairs or even in the basement. When you sit in a tub of hot water, you receive health benefits through passive heating. Most standard-size swim spas can't fit through doors and are often too wide to be moved around the side of a home.</p>
<p>All of a sudden, you could produce a 14′ to 18′ long Swim Spa and offer it for sale anywhere between $13,000 - $25,000 complete, delivered, hooked up and installed and ready for use in a few hours. Modern tubs also usually include hydrotherapy jets, making it possible to have a nice relaxing massage while soaking in the hot tub. They are a combination of swimming pools and tubs. Also check out our JACUZZI® financing options so you can rest easy in your tub without worrying about your bank account.</p>

<p>The Kingfisher is also an all-weather pool and has lights swimmers can use to make sure they're swimming straight against the pool's current. Whether it's carrying the new tub up the stairs, cleaning the bathroom in the middle of installation or just clearing the way, the less time he or she spends in your home, the cheaper your overall Jacuzzi price will be.

We have been researching, ranking and reviewing swim spas for more than four years.</p>
