<p>As inviting and innocuous-looking as your Jacuzzi or hot tub may seem, using it for therapeutic purposes will require more precaution than you probably expect. Your hot tub will have jets and blowers, which can be switch on or off, depending on how you feel. Just like our large range of spas , our selection of swim spa options spans all budgets and specifications.
