<p>Once upon a time the average American family would gather nightly around the table to share dinner and swap stories from their hectic days. The J-335IP, hot tub has an FX10 Therapy seat to fit every contour of the body and features 40 PowerPro® jets which deliver an effective hydromassage across the entire body with jets to target key areas including shoulders, wrists and feet. There is a swimming spa intended for toddlers or children. On a weekly basis, you should consider adding an anti-foaming agent to your hot tub's water. The benefits of hydrotherapy, whether in a swimming pool, or in a spa, are wide-spread.</p>
<p>Medical research is finding that there are many benefits in the use of hot tubs for many people with health problems. If you want to get the most out of our Jacuzzi, the water heater model is right for you. Jacuzzi® is the worldwide leader of hydrotherapy and Spa, and a benchmark for the wellness market. The Jacuzzi Walk in Tubs are shipped from Georgia, Ohio for delivery across North America. Using the 3 jets to swim, the 4 spa seats or just relaxing in the water with just the array of coloured lights tuned on the swim spa is everything and more we expected it to be. Great for exercise and great for relaxing.</p>
<p>The warm water inside the tub can relax spasms, alleviate sprains, backache, and fatigue. This allow you to run your heat pump from your spa controller (not via a separate touchpad), use both heat pump AND electric heater for extra fast heating and extends the life of the heat pump. The heat eases out the tension built up in the muscles and increases the blood flow, which in turn heals the body. With 60 years of experience in manufacturing and a legacy of quality products, you can trust that Jacuzzi® understands quality and is focused on customer satisfaction.</p>
