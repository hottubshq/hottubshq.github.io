<p>Modern homes are starting to take advantage of the corner bathtubs concept. The hotel facility includes an indoor swimming pool, a whirlpool , a sauna, massages, a children's playground and free parking. Keep in mind both swim spas and spas are optimised for different water types, depending on your preference. The trees and fence that you see at the west end start shading the spa from 1.30pm onwards at the spa seat end of the pool which has made it very comfortable during hot summer days.</p>
<p>The first way that we can prevent dehydration while swimming is to ensure that proper amounts of water are being consumed. The Jacuzzi Walk in Tub is built using state-of-the-art machinery, taking pride in carrying on the Jacuzzi® legacy of quality. An advantage of having a small hot tub is that it makes it a lot easier to get it into gardens as many small tubs are designed to be fit through a standard door therefore there is no expense for a crane to get the tub into the garden and it makes it easier to carry the tub into your garden.</p>
<p>However it is also not advisable to spend most of your time swimming. Jacuzzi spas are warranted against water loss due to defects in the spa shell for ten years.

In the late 1960s, Roy Jacuzzi, a third-generation Jacuzzi toyed with the idea of marketing the pump-fitted bath tub dubbed the 'Roman Bathtub' to cater for the growing need for leisure. When Swim Spas first came on the market about 10 years ago, they were priced in the $25,000 range. By having a smaller tub the volume of water is a lot less therefore running cost are reduced due to the heater having less water to heat.</p>
