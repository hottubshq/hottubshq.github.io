<p>That wonderful feeling you get whenever you sit back in a hot tub is because of the way your body reacts to the heat and jets of water. High-end swim spas are also generally larger than mid-range swim spas and include added hydrotherapy and fitness options that aren't found in other swim spas. The Jacuzzi Fast Drain technology drains the water in half the time it takes a standard tub to empty, which is a plus for your comfort while you wait to be able open the door. Come see our large selection of pre-owned hot tubs. Just think of it. Your whole body soaked in hot water, your back and legs and arms being gently massaged by sensual jets of water, with soothing bubbles all around, and feelings of peace and tranquility taking over your body as you close your eyes and start to dream and look back at the kind of day it's been.</p>
<p>The heat widens blood vessels, which sends nutrient-rich blood throughout your body. With the optional integrated Wi-Fi module that works with the Balboa Water Group Wi-Fi Spa Control app, you can remotely control how your hot tub operates, including the lighting, water temperature and running massage pumps. Take a look at the photos below, which demonstrate the various types of Swim Spas in different environments.</p>
<p>The J-575 Hot Tub is the next generation of backyard luxury, showcasing a unique curvilinear design and therapeutic lounge seat for full-body relaxation with more back and hip coverage. For a more challenging workout turn on the swim current and you will experience increased resistance against core, leg and upper body muscle groups. The whole essence of the spa is one of pampering and relaxation and most of the larger spas will have a suite of treatment rooms where you can have massages, facials and a wide range of body treatments.</p>

Swim spas are an excellent way to get a full body workout in a compact space and are perfect for people that love swimming, but don't have room for a large swimming pool.</p>
<p>According to Wikipedia : a Hot Tub is a large tub or small pool full of heated water and used for hydrotherapy or pleasure. Add warmth and water movement and hot tubbing becomes the stuff of lifetime memories. If you do use a hot tub, turn down the temperature and limit your time in the water to less than 10 minutes. A Spa system will use air to push the water around your bath and create that bubble and whirl effects.</p>
<p>As always when making a major purchase, however, it is essential to do your research and check that you are purchasing a good quality swim spa which will last a long time and be safe to use. Chlorine and bromine are both excellent sanitizers used in spas and hot tubs. Indoor hot tubs eliminate the awkwardness of using the tub in front of neighbors or passersby. Cushioned headrests, ergonomic seats, and a host of high-performance features make this the ultimate home spa experience.</p>
<h3>Cool Hot Tubs Westwood MA 02090</h3>
<p>My experience with the Jacuzzi company has been most unpleasant, If you should purchase one of their very expensive walk-in tubs and it needs repair at some point, be prepared to fix it yourself as the company has forgotten you name after the sale is made. In addition, some manufacturers offer pools with an easy-to-clean Gelcoat surface that helps minimize algae build up and creates a barrier against moisture absorption.</p>
<p>Don't forget that apart from the initial purchase expense, there will be monthly expenses for maintaining Jacuzzi tubs Those expenses will be the electricity to keep the water at the right temperature, chemicals to keep the ph levels safe and water to keep it at the right level. The Hydrozone has comfortable seating for the entire family, up to 68 jets, up to four high volume swim jets and 5 pumps. I had been swimming regularly at a public pool and found it crowded and chemically distasteful.</p>
<p>The Jacuzzi can be enjoyed at any time of the year, that is for a full 365 days, perhaps to cool off on a warm sultry day or to warm up on a winters evening. Our offered Jacuzzi Massage Bath Tubis an integral part of places such as spas and other wellness centers. Because we take pride in our products, Royal Spa swim spas have a lower cost of ownership than our competitors, though our sticker price will not be lowest you can find.</p>
<p>But spa” is also used as the American term for a hot tub equipped with strong jets that mix air into the water for a more pronounced massage effect. The point is this, if you spend a little time in your hot tub and get yourself to the point where you really enjoy this time, then you are doing much better than becoming addicted to pain killers. Take the first step toward finding your hot tub by browsing Hot Spring spa collections.</p>
