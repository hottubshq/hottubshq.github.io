<p>When people refer to a hot tub or a spa, they often think of the word Jacuzzi. When you exercise in one of these spas, you will be utilizing every muscle group in your body in a controlled setting. Given that the skill level to install a Jacuzzi bathtub is fairly high, most homeowners hire a pro. It produces a certain water current that allows you to swim there for as long as you want without hitting any walls. We had a jacuzzi tub in our old home and the jets never seemed clean no matter what I tried.</p>

<p>By choosing a swim spa, you can swim without doing laps in a regular sized pool. Hot tubs can replace what used to happen nightly at the dinner table. The benefits of using jetted bathtubs should never be underestimated. Swim spas would waste a single penny of yours. Swim spas tend to have large seating areas, as they are primarily used for relaxation rather than swimming. This has added jets that release high pressure water, making you feel like you are swimming against the current.</p>

<h3>Hot Tub For Two Sneads Ferry NC 28460</h3>
<p>It is best to run the water tests everyday to ensure the purity of the hot-tub water. No swimming pool experience would be complete without room for water toys. All Vortex Swim Spas have topside recesses to place your glasses and bottles. Even if you don't feel comfortable doing this in a showroom where the hot tubs are for sale, you should get into the shell and test the comfort level of the seats. Remember that swim spas are mechanical products and like a car you'll need replacement parts from time to time.</p>
<p>Approved safety locks - A quality approved locking cover is just as accepted as a fully fenced spa pool. Since every policy is a little different in their treatment of hot tubs, make sure you check with your insurance provider or read your policy to make sure you understand the specifics of your coverage. It might even be called a spa as in the Lay zee spa brand in the UK, but, if it's freestanding, semi-permanent and has inbuilt filtration and heating then it's a hot tub.</p>
<p>Modern hot tubs are very different to the traditional variety. The hot-tub cover not only keeps children away from mishaps but also disallows debris, insects, pets and rodents from entering the tub. The Jacuzzi ClearRay water management system simplifies cleaning and maintenance, and the company developed the SmartTub mobile app used to monitor and control many of its hot tubs. Swim spas are hybrid hot tubs.</p>
<p>The jets are useful for water massage or hydrotherapy. A water current generated by five turbo jets enable swimmers to swim counter current and thus keep fit. If you are hiring a hot tub for that special occasion for a loved one, a small gathering or a large event, hot tubs are a perfect way to make it an event to remember. Websites such as Lowe's or Home Depot have a wide range of indoor Jacuzzis and whirlpools.</p>
