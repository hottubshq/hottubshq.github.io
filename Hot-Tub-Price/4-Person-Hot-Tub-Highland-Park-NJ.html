In the late 1960s, Roy Jacuzzi, a third-generation Jacuzzi toyed with the idea of marketing the pump-fitted bath tub dubbed the 'Roman Bathtub' to cater for the growing need for leisure. When Swim Spas first came on the market about 10 years ago, they were priced in the $25,000 range.

<p>A soak in the hot tub is also helpful for stimulating healthy blood flow and stress relief. Sitting in a hot tub spa with the water temperature no higher than 104 degrees helps relax your body. Most cases are tied to indoor hot tubs, where there is less ventilation. An advantage of swim spas over a traditional swimming pool is its ability to be used year round.

<p>Hot tubs are a wonderful excuse for getting out in the garden more often, and with care they can be designed to blend into their surroundings so they don't stick out as an eyesore.
