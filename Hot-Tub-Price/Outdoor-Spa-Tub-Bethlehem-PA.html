Thanks to the MP line, you can enjoy full-body effects of aquatic exercise with time saving convenience in the privacy of your own home. A backlit buoyancy jet helps maintain ideal swimming position while stabilizing hip jets ensures the swimmer remains centered in the swim lane. Although, hot tubs and spas are convenient to use, they have a shortcoming associated with them also. If your hot tub pump seal is leaking, you will need to find the correct seal kit.</p>
<p>When you put Jacuzzi® Pro Grade Pool Equipment in your backyard, you trust its performance.
