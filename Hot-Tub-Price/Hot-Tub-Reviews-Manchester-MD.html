<p>A hot tub is a large home made or manufactured tub filled with hot water. We are offering Waterfall Jacuzzito our client and our product is made of good quality. These swim spas are usually made in North America (making parts easier and cheaper to source) and come with a more robust warranty. Making this a great time to buy a hot tub. Hydrotherapy from home spas allows unique health benefits. The 5.5 Series Aqua Swim is a plunge pool, never ending swimming pool, hydrotherapy spa and aqua-aerobics centre all in one.</p>
<p>Water constantly passes over the steel tube creating a consistent and reliable heating pattern. One of the greater benefits that comes with a swim spa is in the form of efficiency and portability. Hotel Alfonska offers for guests not only accommodation and meals, but the tennis courts or whirlpool for 4 persons too. Many swim spas also offer the option of swim jets in addition to the hydrotherapy jets. Baths, swimming pools, jacuzzi are turned off 10 minutes to closing of the Aqua Park.</p>

These tubs offer you the same relaxing feeling that a hot tub does. 1. 3 HP Water pump (2 pumps), 2 circulation pumps and 41 jets.</p>
<p>Vortex dual layer system keeps the heat from the pumps and plumbing, reduces noise and provides a warm layer between the water and the outside of the spa.
