<p>Every summer the open water swimming season peppers the calendar, and for years I have shrugged it off with complete apathy. Initially, they took to soaking in hot water filled wine barrels and other large wooden vessels and they, logically enough, called these hot tubs. When you use a sauna, jacuzzi, hot tub or steam room, your body is unable to lose heat effectively by sweating. The acidic quality of vinegar eats away at oily residue that has built up in the tub as well as the calcium and other chemical deposits in the jets and tubing.</p>

With regards to hot tubs, there are many companies out there trying to get you to buy their tubs with prices ranging for £1,000 up to £15,000 and the price you pay does affect the quality of the product slightly, as the more expensive ones will be a lot larger tub as well as having additional accessories like, TV, and sound systems built in.</p>
<p>Swimming in a swim spa adds extra benefits. That is why if you notice, the jets are usually positioned at the most stressed muscles of the body - the calves, neck, some at the back, and at the sole of the feet. We favored those that sell spas with paddlewheel current systems, since they're usually the strongest. The bath water is recirculated through the jets, which keeps the water a bit warmer than air being forced in the bath.</p>

<p>The American Bath Factory Champagne Jester Jetted Rolltop is a great example of the functionality of jetted bathtubs. Instead of seating, they have strong water jets that create a current strong enough for you to swim against.

<p>Also, our Jacuzzi bathtub is designed using topmost grade material and progressive technology in conformity with latest market trends. Due to the hot, damp environment that occurs around a swim spa, even the hardiest of timbers will be susceptible to mold and mildew. You do not drain the water from a hot tub after each use.

The jetted bathtubs that use water jets force the bath water through the jets. One method is to time a "stroke cycle", starting a watch when the swimmer's right arm enters the water and stopping the watch when the right arm re-enters the water. In the 1980s, swim spas were invented, yet they didn't come popular until the last decade.</p>
