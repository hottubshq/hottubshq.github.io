<p>Indoor hot tubs offer many conveniences that can't be found with outdoor tubs. If you are able to use a gas heater or heat pump (which offers savings of up to 75%). This bathtub exceeded my expectations. They say that swimmers are more prone to dehydration because it causes high levels of exertion in the body, but swimmers do not feel the urge to drink because they are immersed within the water and therefore the brain is not aware of the need for water, and other liquids.</p>
