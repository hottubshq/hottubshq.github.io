<p>A guy named Dr. Stephen Blair (University of South Carolina) conducted an extended survey to study the effectiveness of swimming for fitness. All swim spa covers are made specifically to fit your Master Spas swim spa and come 6" thick in the middle and taper off to 4". This cover includes an energy efficient 1.5 lb foam density and a 24 R-value, with a full length heat seal and upgraded rubber grip handles (included!). We had limited space and the swim spa allowed us to maximise the use of our garden and has proven to be far more economical than a pool.</p>
<p>Due to the fact that heat rises, it is the spa cover that contains this heat. We put family with a firm focus on kids at the forefront of our mind when we set about designing our range of swim spas. Before any piece of Jacuzzi® Pro Grade Pool Equipment leaves the factory, it is thoroughly tested in a state-of-the-art facility. Quality spas provide their owners with years of use and reliable performance. An H2X Fitness Swim Spa by Master Spas combines the benefits of water exercise with the therapy of a hot tub so you can own your wellness and win your day.</p>
<p>This new and innovative way to take your swim spa cover on and off makes swim spa sessions easier than ever. Jacuzzi developed the first hot tub pump 60 years ago and continues to provide innovative hydrotherapy products and features.

Some Jacuzzi bathtubs have the ability to run even when there is no water in the tub. In addition, there are any physical health benefits to using a hot tub. Clearwater Spas prides itself in producing no VOC's (Volatile Organic Compound) that pollute the atmosphere.</p>
<p>Smaller 2 person spas normally need more frequent water changes than larger 8 person spas (except if 8 people are using the spa more than twice a week!). A primary reason people buy swim spas is to swim laps without needing a big pool. As larger units were designed to accommodate more people, Jacuzzi® incorporated heating and filtration systems to keep the water warm and clean, thus creating the first hot tub in 1970.</p>

<p>With the burgeoning interest in health and leisure across the United States, yet another opportunity was spotted in the 1960s, by Roy Jacuzzi, who invented and marketed the first self-contained, fully-integrated whirlpool bath, creating a whole new industry almost on his own.
