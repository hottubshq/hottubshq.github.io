<p>Swimming accessories are important for summer safety if you plan on swimming. With Jacuzzi for Life, you have the option of purchasing any 300, 400, 500 or LX series hot tub. Innovative jet pump & equipment technology and newer manufacturing methods made the cost of production of the Swim Spa to come down to the levels of a high quality portable hot tub. The biggest factor to consider in terms of cost is the price of the Jacuzzi bathtub itself. Many people ask themselves if it's worth it to invest in a swim spa.</p>
<p>Swim spas definitely are not cheap, but they are about half the price of a nice pool. In pools, you worry about turns, running into the wall, or jumping too deep that you hit the ground, swim spas erase these concerns and the possibility of these incidents.
