<p>We all know that spas and hot tubs have been around for numerous amounts of years, this being said the old economical spas always had there setbacks. A massage, body treatment, or esthetics treatment is the perfect addition to your time in our world famous natural hot mineral water. Hot Tub manufactures have improved the jets to give a better hydrotherapeutic effect. All swim spas, hot tubs , and Jacuzzis contain jets to mix air with pressurized water to provide a massage experience. Perspiration caused due to a sauna bath helps in opening up skin pores and expulsion of body toxins and impurities.</p>
<p>Induced air: The jets may use a venturi effect to incorporate air into the water stream for a lighter massage effect; this requires another set of hoses. I know that sounds obvious, but many people dont consider the consequences of putting a hot tub inside the house, upstairs or even in the basement. When you sit in a tub of hot water, you receive health benefits through passive heating. Most standard-size swim spas can't fit through doors and are often too wide to be moved around the side of a home.</p>
<p>Many public pools require women and men with long hair to wear a swim cap while in the pool. Salt can clog the motor that powers air or water jets on other brands or rust out the pump or heater. Heat pumps provide only great benefits when added to your spa pool or swim spa. Take a look at all the wonderful videos on our video page to get a feel for all the different pools, spas and swim spas on the market today.</p>
