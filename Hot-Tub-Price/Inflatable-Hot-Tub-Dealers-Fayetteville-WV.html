<p>In our modern, high-tech society, everything gets reviewed these days.

<p>Swimming in a swim spa adds extra benefits. That is why if you notice, the jets are usually positioned at the most stressed muscles of the body - the calves, neck, some at the back, and at the sole of the feet. We favored those that sell spas with paddlewheel current systems, since they're usually the strongest. The bath water is recirculated through the jets, which keeps the water a bit warmer than air being forced in the bath.</p>
<p>The water in NSPs is 100 percent free from chemicals making it very desirable for swimming. Endless Pools has only a few accessories for sale, although it does sell underwater exercise equipment.
