<p>Many people dream of installing a swimming pool in their backyards. Browse through the catalogs to find premium quality corner bathtubs, couple bathtubs, oval bathtubs, round series bathtubs, jacuzzis bathtubs, etc. Pay a little more and you'll get a better swimming experience, better components and lower running costs.

Also, swim spas require a metal frame for support (which does not like being underground) and have the equipment (which requires access) inside the cabinet.
