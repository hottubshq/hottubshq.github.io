<p>Many women all over the world have questions about their bodies in regards to yeast infections. The level of hydrotherapy that a spa can offer is based on the quality and function of the jets. Jacuzzi TargetPro jets are fully adjustable and customizable and designed to direct the whirlpool action to any desired target area. If the Jacuzzi bathtub has this feature, run it after each time you use the bathtub. Once you have a sense of the type and size of hot tub that works best for you, it's also worth considering other factors that will make your experience more enjoyable.</p>
