<p>A lot of people ask what is the difference between a swim spa and a swimming pool? When you install your hot tub or pool you may or may not have used conduit or a duct that is buried in your garden for protecting the cables, if there is spare capacity, you can feed your power and cable leads through the duct to the location normally on a wall near the pool or hot tub. While some spas still use wooden tubs, there are many private spas that use specially designed hot tubs and whirlpools to create a relaxing atmosphere for their clients while still using the healing power of warm water.</p>

<p>Enjoy the best of both worlds: a relaxing spa pool and water-based exercise swim spa in the comfort of your backyard. One of the top concerns when dealing with a Jacuzzi bathtub is the growth of bacteria and mold within the jets and tubing.
