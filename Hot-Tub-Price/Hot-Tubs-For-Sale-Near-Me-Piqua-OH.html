Illumatherapy also offers four points of entry, with two on each side of the tub, and air bubbles spraying from the jets give the appearance of dancing as they reflect the light. The blowers make the hot tub feel like you've got your own personal geyser - forcing air from the bottom of the pool, and creating a very relaxing environment for you.</p>
<p>Look for pools that offer a strong, adjustable current so you to change the water from a low speed for easy workouts and rehab to higher speeds for full intensity swimming or fitness routines.

<p>Jacuzzi bathtubs are considered a luxury and not something found in the average home. So, let's take a look at what's so great about these two hot tub brands. Just like hot tub spas, most Swim Spas are molded out of acrylic and are typically 12' - 24' in length. It is also worth inquiring on what type of insulation they have as some cheap hot tub will have none, and therefore cost more to run but some other cheap hot tubs are well insulated and will be cheaper to run.</p>

Designed to improve your lifestyle and offer a better way of taking care of yourself, Jacuzzi® hot tubs are the most complete and versatile synthesis of shared well-being.</p>

Jacuzzi doesn't mention warranties for their walk-in tubs specifically on their website, but for reference, their whirlpool tubs come with a limited lifetime warranty. Swim spas as typically smaller than lap pools, but offer varied jet speeds and intensity for a customized swim workout that changes as skills improve.</p>
