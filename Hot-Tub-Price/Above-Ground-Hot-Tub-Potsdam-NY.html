<p>OK, class ~ it's time to define the true meaning of the different types of hot water therapy. Swim spas are covered by a thick insulated cover and are lined with an insulation of polyurethane, therefore the cost of running the unit is much less than that of a regular pool and, of course, even lower than the cost of operating both a pool and a hot tub. You do need to have the correct measurements if you plan to use one of these kits for building a swim spa or hot tub enclosure with a hot tub cover because all the materials are pre cut to the lengths that you need for the size of gazebo you choose.</p>
<p>Even though the swimming space is smaller than in a regular pool, it is still larger than most swim spas, and you have the option of including swim jets if you want a more intensive swimming experience. Furthermore, customers can avail this acrylic bathtub from us at market prices. All Vortex swim spa frames use top quality, durable steel. Complete Jacuzzi or whirlpool kits with strategically placed Hydro-jet Nozzles.</p>

Our insulation system harnesses all the heat from the pumps and the heater inside the spa cabinet while reflecting the colder outside air away from the spa. This is why we make Royal Spa Swim Spas from components that can be found at most pool and spa supply stores.</p>
