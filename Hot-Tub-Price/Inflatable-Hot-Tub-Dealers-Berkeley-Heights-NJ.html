<p>A guy named Dr. Stephen Blair (University of South Carolina) conducted an extended survey to study the effectiveness of swimming for fitness. All swim spa covers are made specifically to fit your Master Spas swim spa and come 6" thick in the middle and taper off to 4". This cover includes an energy efficient 1.5 lb foam density and a 24 R-value, with a full length heat seal and upgraded rubber grip handles (included!). We had limited space and the swim spa allowed us to maximise the use of our garden and has proven to be far more economical than a pool.</p>
<p>It can be difficult to carve out the time you need to focus on your fitness, health, and family. The modular design also allows for pools of varying sizes from 7′ x 12′ to 10′ x 16′ with water depths up to 6′ deep. The idea behind the Jacuzzi tub is to bring the great features of an outdoor hot tub inside. Jacuzzi® J-400 hot tubs come in a variety of configurations including smaller 2-3 person tubs and a large 8-9 person hot tub.</p>
<p>You can even get the Swim Spa, which seats around five to seven people. Some Swim Spas are constructed with fiberglass composite similar to the hull of a boat. We offer only wood-fired hot tubs.

Shopping for a hot tub should be an easy experience.</p>

<p>Saunas induce sweating, which causes a decrease in the body's toxic load and thereby promotes better health. Next, it is important that you check the pH balance of the water in your jacuzzi style hot tub on a regular basis. Some of these are heated in the traditional way with wood fires and there are some companies that rent them out and run experience days where you can use traditional hot tubs in the peace and tranquillity of unspoilt woodland and other open spaces.</p>
