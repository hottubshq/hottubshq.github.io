<p>Just like hot tub spas, most Swim Spas are molded out of acrylic and are typically 12′ - 24′ in length. The unique shell design of the MP line of swim spas gives you a long and wide swim area with no hidden obstacles like benches or steps to hit your feet.

Since every policy is a little different in their treatment of hot tubs, make sure you check with your insurance provider or read your policy to make sure you understand the specifics of your coverage. It might even be called a spa as in the Lay zee spa brand in the UK, but, if it's freestanding, semi-permanent and has inbuilt filtration and heating then it's a hot tub.</p>
<p>We want to be seen as the brand spearheading innovations in swimspa technology, like our hydraulically balanced plumbing which ensures the correct water pressure to the hydrotherapy jets or the WaveRider Control. Lucky for you, a swim spa can offer a more controlled environment to help your kids learn the basics of swimming. They can also look more attractive than swim spas, thanks to the extensive range of exterior cladding and pool colour choices they offer.</p>
