<p>A lot of people ask what is the difference between a swim spa and a swimming pool? When you install your hot tub or pool you may or may not have used conduit or a duct that is buried in your garden for protecting the cables, if there is spare capacity, you can feed your power and cable leads through the duct to the location normally on a wall near the pool or hot tub. While some spas still use wooden tubs, there are many private spas that use specially designed hot tubs and whirlpools to create a relaxing atmosphere for their clients while still using the healing power of warm water.</p>
<p>The drastic price difference while having the same benefits give swim spas an advantage over the other options. There are Hot tub on the marketplace now that are designed for two people only; therefore the tubs are much smaller to the traditional larger hot tubs. These smaller sized swim spas can still accommodate several bathers, although if you're taller than average it might feel a little small. Another great characteristic that comes with owning a swim spa is that its maintenance is so much easier then it would be with owning a swimming pool.</p>
<p>Just like hot tub spas, most Swim Spas are molded out of acrylic and are typically 12′ - 24′ in length. The unique shell design of the MP line of swim spas gives you a long and wide swim area with no hidden obstacles like benches or steps to hit your feet. Avoid hot tubs if you can during those 9 months. If you are looking for a free-standing pool with heated water, hydrotherapy jets, filtration system and one that is semi-permanent then a hot tub is what you need.</p>
