These swim spas are usually made in North America (making parts easier and cheaper to source) and come with a more robust warranty. Making this a great time to buy a hot tub. Hydrotherapy from home spas allows unique health benefits. The 5.5 Series Aqua Swim is a plunge pool, never ending swimming pool, hydrotherapy spa and aqua-aerobics centre all in one.</p>
<p>If you've ever wondered what a hot tub is, the simplest definition comes from ancient times when the tubs were made of wood and their purpose was water treatment. Most importantly, cheap swim spas are prone to shell failure which will require a potential warranty claim if it needs to be replaced.

These centers usually have more than one pool which caters to guests of different swimming requirements. These bacteria are found naturally in water, and hot tubs that aren't disinfected properly can become contaminated with Legionella, according to the CDC.</p>
