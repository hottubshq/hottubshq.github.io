<p>In 1956 the Jacuzzi brothers invented the original hydrotherapy jet, today with 60 years' experience in hydrotherapy: Jacuzzi® is the brand when you are looking for a hot tub or bathroom products. They utilize the highest quality parts and design to deliver a stronger, wider and smoother swimming experience then other swim spas can. Today, we can derive the benefits of saunas in terms of weight loss, cardiovascular health, treatment of many skin disorders and beauty needs, immune system boosting and as adjunctive therapy to treatment of a number of other disorders. This one is the largest of all the tubs on our list, seating up to 8 people and this time customers say it's true to size.</p>
<p>The areas around the pump and tubes need clearance as well in case any repairs are needed down the line. If the pH level becomes too low, the water will become acidic, irritating the skin of swimmers and causing corrosive damage to your spa or pool. All Jacuzzi® Hot Tubs have a five stage filtration and ClearRay bulb, ensuring your water is quickly and easily cleared of all debris ready for use. In total, there are 14 swim spas to pick from - that's the largest selection of the companies we reviewed, matched only by Hydropool's inventory.</p>
<p>The three different kinds of containers used for hot tubs are wooden barrels, fibreglass whirlpools, or large bathtubs. Michael Phelps Signature Swim Spas were developed with input from 23-time gold medalist Michael Phelps and his coach Bob Bowman for all types of training, swimming, fitness programs and aquatic therapy. For people looking to rid their bodies of excess toxins and water, a jacuzzi provides a great opportunity for body detoxification.</p>
