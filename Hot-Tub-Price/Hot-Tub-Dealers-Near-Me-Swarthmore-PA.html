<p>In 1956 the Jacuzzi brothers invented the original hydrotherapy jet, today with 60 years' experience in hydrotherapy: Jacuzzi® is the brand when you are looking for a hot tub or bathroom products. They utilize the highest quality parts and design to deliver a stronger, wider and smoother swimming experience then other swim spas can. Today, we can derive the benefits of saunas in terms of weight loss, cardiovascular health, treatment of many skin disorders and beauty needs, immune system boosting and as adjunctive therapy to treatment of a number of other disorders.

<p>With a Balboa hot tub, life is simpler and happier - just the warm water and you communing to drive the stress away from your mind and eliminate the toxins from your body. Our most compact swim spa, the X200 combines our new jetted swim current with the mental and physical health benefits of hydromassage. Due to the wiring of many spas not being capable of supporting a large pump as well as the heater at the same time, a ‘load shed' setting is adopted or the heater is simply turns off completely while the spa is in use.</p>
<p>Product offerings include whirlpool baths, outdoor hot tubs, showers, sanitary ware, bath tubs, as well as fixtures and accessories. Allow the water to drop and keep a close eye on it. Turn off the jets and slowly let the water drop in the tub. A perfect example of the confusion that exists: a hot tub, to me, is not a spa, and it's certainly not a Jacuzzi. Jacuzzi keeps things simple by only offering two walk-in tub lines: the Jacuzzi Walk-In Tub and the Finestra Bathtub.</p>

However, they are designed to be smaller than regular pools, as their primary function is relaxation, although the swim jets do enable you to swim effectively within the space. Sure it looks like fun seeing all of the foam that can result from hot water, jets and bubble bath, but it's a sorry mess to clean up. Typically it's best to drain the tub and start over with fresh water if bubble bath or high sudsing agents have been added to the hot tub either accidentally or as a prank.</p>
<p>With Jacuzzi for Life you can experience the luxury of stress-free maintenance and brand new technology every three years for the rest of your life.
