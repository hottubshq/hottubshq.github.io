<p>If you want a bathtub that can double as a place to wash your body, as well as soak and relax, you will want to consider jetted bathtubs, or the more common name, whirlpool tub. But spa” is also used as the American term for a hot tub equipped with strong jets that mix air into the water for a more pronounced massage effect. The point is this, if you spend a little time in your hot tub and get yourself to the point where you really enjoy this time, then you are doing much better than becoming addicted to pain killers. Take the first step toward finding your hot tub by browsing Hot Spring spa collections.</p>
<p>Due to the advanced design and high-grade materials that's used to craft each and every Hydropool Swim Spa, they can offer many years of use. It is smaller than a regular swimming pool, but larger than a spa, so it offers enough space to swim in. However, like a spa, it is equipped with spa jets, so you can enjoy the benefits of relaxation and pain relief that hydrotherapy offers. This is why we have designed our swim spas from the ground up to be used all year.</p>
<p>The Vortex control system will adapt and tune itself to the thermal properties of your spa pool and its environment, day to day, season to season, this will reduce 'on-demand heating'. As a fun way to unwind and relieve stress, hot tubs and home spas allow family members to have fun conversation while relaxing together. Sensing the American consumers interest in health, fitness and leisure activities, Roy invented and marketed the first self-contained, fully integrated whirlpool bath in 1968.</p>

<p>Some of our swim spas have seating along the sides of the spa as well like myLapswim This gives more room for people to sit and enjoy a massage but reduces the pool area at the swim jet end. Most Fantasy hot tubs are plug-n-play for easy installation and operation. Two-in-one swim spa design combines a swim current with hydro massage luxury. Aqua Spas offers both the Michael Phelps and H2X series from Master Spas, giving you top-of-the-line swim spas to choose from.</p>

<p>A hot tub may be covered as an other structure by some insurance policies. However, this can negatively impact the swimming experience, which is the focal point of purchasing a swim spa. This is not very critical in the maintenance of your Hot Tub but of course, a pleasing visual appeal of clear water will considerably add to the experience. Built-in features like handrails, seats and textured floors add to the safety of using a bathtub.</p>
<p>It has the new River Jet swim system with Viper pumps, and plenty of water features. Whisper-quiet motors, colorful lighting, dancing air bubbles, powerful jets — your bath is an expression of yourself and an extension of how you want to feel. Most indoor kinds hold one or two people simply because the available space is limited to the standard size bathroom. Similar to a regular bathtub you would see in a home, these hot tubs, sometimes called whirlpool baths or Jacuzzis, are filled with water for each use than drained when your soaking is complete.</p>
<p>Medical research is finding that there are many benefits in the use of hot tubs for many people with health problems. If you want to get the most out of our Jacuzzi, the water heater model is right for you. Jacuzzi® is the worldwide leader of hydrotherapy and Spa, and a benchmark for the wellness market. The Jacuzzi Walk in Tubs are shipped from Georgia, Ohio for delivery across North America. Using the 3 jets to swim, the 4 spa seats or just relaxing in the water with just the array of coloured lights tuned on the swim spa is everything and more we expected it to be. Great for exercise and great for relaxing.</p>

<p>The three different kinds of containers used for hot tubs are wooden barrels, fibreglass whirlpools, or large bathtubs. Michael Phelps Signature Swim Spas were developed with input from 23-time gold medalist Michael Phelps and his coach Bob Bowman for all types of training, swimming, fitness programs and aquatic therapy. For people looking to rid their bodies of excess toxins and water, a jacuzzi provides a great opportunity for body detoxification.</p>
<p>Indoor tubs may produce some moisture when in use, particularly if the ambient room temperature is much less than the water inside the vessel (hot tub water temperatures range from 100-104 degrees F). Those planning an indoor installation need to think about how long they'll use it and perhaps consider installing an exhaust fan to pull moisture from the room. The water inside a swim spa can provide a much more comfortable and enjoyable environment for low-impact exercise.</p>
<p>Originated in 1970 as a commercial swimming pool company and in 1978 became one of the first hot tub retailers in North America. In tune with advanced market developments, we are providing Bathtub Repair Service. Some walk-in tubs feature heated seats to help the bather stay warm while waiting for the tub to fill and drain. If you are buying the swim spa for a family-type, year-round pool, you might not worry too much about having a strong current.</p>
<p>Our innovative use of LED has changed the way spa pools are being lit. You certainly can relax more effectively in your hot tub when you keep those custom spa covers in place when you are not actively using your spa or hot tub. Cheap hot tub does not mean they are poor quality they will just not have all the luxury extra item with them. Once inside your Italian Design hot tub, you can indulge in the ultimate hydrotherapy massage - whilst from the outside, you can indulge your senses in truly iconic design.</p>
