<p>Hot tub pumps are critical for any spa. You want to stay hydrated while soaking and drinking a cool glass” of water, fruit juice or tea is such a pleasant way to go. But it's so easy to drop a glass” made of glass and have it shatter on the way to the tub or once you're soaking. Hot tubs are usually heated using an electric or natural gas heater, though there are also submersible wood fire hot tub heaters, as well as solar hot water systems. This includes a self-cleaning option and an independent heater so your water heater does not take such a beating every time it tries to fill up the tub.</p>

<p>Four pumps give this piece of equipment a lot of water flow, for therapy and exercise. Funny you should ask, because we happen to have a video that produced in 2008 at the Artesian Spas factory in Las Vegas, NV.

Unless you've specifically added additional coverage for your hot tub, any damages to it may not be covered by your regular policy.</p>
<p>You can still by spas and hot tubs under the Jacuzzi name. For example, a 60-gallon tub would require a 40-gallon water heater. As explained above, in the ‘What is the best filtration system for your spa pool” section, there are three main types of pumps, two-speed, single speed jet and single speed circulation. Unlike any other quality of hose, this particular PVC piping has the ability to withstand the spa pool environment of temperatures between -26 and +70 degrees Celsius.</p>
