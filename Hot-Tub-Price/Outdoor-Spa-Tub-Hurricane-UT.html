<p>That wonderful feeling you get whenever you sit back in a hot tub is because of the way your body reacts to the heat and jets of water. High-end swim spas are also generally larger than mid-range swim spas and include added hydrotherapy and fitness options that aren't found in other swim spas. The Jacuzzi Fast Drain technology drains the water in half the time it takes a standard tub to empty, which is a plus for your comfort while you wait to be able open the door. Come see our large selection of pre-owned hot tubs. Just think of it. Your whole body soaked in hot water, your back and legs and arms being gently massaged by sensual jets of water, with soothing bubbles all around, and feelings of peace and tranquility taking over your body as you close your eyes and start to dream and look back at the kind of day it's been.</p>
<p>However, there are also disadvantages with such a design because the heat of the sun will be bearing down on you during the day and there is the increased possibility of dirt and debris blowing into the water of the tub. Some Sapphire spas have seats full of jets that we've positioned to target problem areas of the back, neck, and shoulders.

<p>Deluxe 4-person hot tub with 40 hydrotherapy massage jets and a full body lounge.
