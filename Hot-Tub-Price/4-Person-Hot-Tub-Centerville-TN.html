Hot tubs have no such current, but the water often swirls and bubbles around sitters as they relax.</p>

If you swim seriously, swim jets are not ideal, as competitive swimming always takes place in natural conditions, so you will not gain a realistic idea of your times and progress if you are practising in a swim spa.
