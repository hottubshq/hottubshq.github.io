<p>Indoor tubs may produce some moisture when in use, particularly if the ambient room temperature is much less than the water inside the vessel (hot tub water temperatures range from 100-104 degrees F).

The water inside a swim spa can provide a much more comfortable and enjoyable environment for low-impact exercise.</p>
