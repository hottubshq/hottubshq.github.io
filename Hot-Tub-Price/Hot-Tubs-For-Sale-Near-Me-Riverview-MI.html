<p>Hot Tubs Rock is a local and independently owned company based in Magor, South Wales. On the other end, a pair of powerful swim jets produce one of the smoothest swim currents in the industry, fully adjustable for any level swimmer, with a backlit buoyancy jet that illuminates the swim current and combines the perfect amount of air to elevate the swimmer into the ideal position. Our collection of swim and fitness spas are the pinnacle of performance and style providing improved wellness and a better quality of life conveniently at home.</p>

Deluxe 6-person hot tub with 20 hydrotherapy massage jets and a full body lounge. Innovative features include ergonomic seating, hydrotherapy jets, and strong filtration. Jacuzzi AccuPro jets are the building blocks for Jacuzzi's Whirlpool tub, and send out a precise, pinpointed flow of water and air to target specific trouble spots on the user's body.</p>
<p>Your body opens up the blood vessels because it thinks you are getting too warm and the ones near the surface of the skin relax in an effort to release heat. In addition, we look for swim spa manufacturers that offer a variety of extras to enhance your swim spa experience, including spa covers, underwater workout equipment, sound systems, railings and LED lights. Best of all, it helps keep the Jacuzzi bathtub free of bacteria.</p>

So it is no surprise that some of the best spas in the world are found at hotels and resorts.</p>
