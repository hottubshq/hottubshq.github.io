They utilize the highest quality parts and design to deliver a stronger, wider and smoother swimming experience then other swim spas can. Today, we can derive the benefits of saunas in terms of weight loss, cardiovascular health, treatment of many skin disorders and beauty needs, immune system boosting and as adjunctive therapy to treatment of a number of other disorders. This one is the largest of all the tubs on our list, seating up to 8 people and this time customers say it's true to size.</p>
<p>A therapeutic spa and swimming pool combined into one, swim spas are designed with more space for exercise and play at one end and the benefits of hydro massage at the other.

Your sore aching neck and back muscles will love our spas water and air jets. We are proud to be your online retailer of H2X swim spa covers and Michael Phelps swim spas covers.</p>
<p>Swim spas can often be used like regular hot tubs. The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG) states that becoming overheated in a hot tub is not recommended during pregnancy. If a swim spa isn't quite what you're looking for, there are a wide range of alternatives to swim spas in Australia. When it comes to setting standards for swim spa covers, the Smartop Vanish Swim Spa Cover (XTST113) sets the bar high.</p>

In addition, the swimmer can adjust the direction of the water-flow for each river jet to ensure their swimming experience is perfect for their swimming style.</p>

<p>A Jacuzzi needs to have an energy saver system so as to be more economical in use and also to be more green to the planet - obviously an energy efficient hot tub will save the consumer money and use less precious energy thereby reducing ones carbon footprint which is very politically correct. Jacuzzi TheraPro jets combine power with higher water flow and air integration for a more vigorous and even massage.</p>

The Michael Phelps Signature Series Swim Spas by Master Spas, provide an unmatched experience. However, if you would like all the benefits of hydrotherapy but with more space for swimming, you could consider a pool and spa combo. To prevent this, take specified breaks from the exercise to drink water, and ensure that at least a half gallon of water is being consumed each day - to prevent these swimming dehydration risks.</p>
<p>Lastly, Jacuzzi tubs are the perfect accessory to relax sore muscles and relieve joint pain. Currently, Jacuzzi is the world's most recognized whirl pool brand name. Not only does a Vortex Swim Spa have less water to heat, but when combined with our Vortex Hybrid Heat Pump it's the most cost effective heated swimming pool option.
