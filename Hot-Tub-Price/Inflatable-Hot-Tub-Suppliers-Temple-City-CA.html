Owning an at-home pool or hot tub can be fun for the whole family.</p>
<p>Look for swim spas that are insulated to keep in the heat and pumps and motors that are rated more energy efficient. When you get the hot tubs, the first thing you need to do it to read the installation manual very carefully. Obviously spa pools are wet areas. The self-cleaning swim spas clean 100% of the water in the unit in just 45 minutes, so you can spend more time enjoying your swim spa.
