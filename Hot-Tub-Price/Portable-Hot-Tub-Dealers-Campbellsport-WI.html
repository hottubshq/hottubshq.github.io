<p>For the care of the body we rely on Jacuzzi company that for over 5 decades of experience, research and innovation, offers hot tub for the pure wellness, to be joyfully shared with others. One of the most important Jacuzzi tub accessories is the motor that helps run the jets. Our Swim Spa Suite is the perfect option, as it offers the best physical therapy and romantic therapy all wrapped up in one economical spa package. Most swim spas take up less space than traditional small in-ground pools. A hot tub is (usually) a round wooden tank with a simple bench seat and 4-8 jets around the side. The Great Backyard Place also recommends you give plenty of thought to where you want to put the hot tub or swim spa you buy.</p>
<p>Swimlife is in the swimspa business for life and the only way to ensure success is to produce, offer and innovate the highest quality swimspas possible. Also, swim spas require a metal frame for support (which does not like being underground) and have the equipment (which requires access) inside the cabinet. Above ground hot tubs are freestanding basins that can be positioned anywhere, provided that there is connection to electric energy.</p>
<p>All of a sudden, you could produce a 14′ to 18′ long Swim Spa and offer it for sale anywhere between $13,000 - $25,000 complete, delivered, hooked up and installed and ready for use in a few hours. Modern tubs also usually include hydrotherapy jets, making it possible to have a nice relaxing massage while soaking in the hot tub. They are a combination of swimming pools and tubs. Also check out our JACUZZI® financing options so you can rest easy in your tub without worrying about your bank account.</p>

Two swim jets that provide a wider, deeper, and smoother current than other systems on the market. They can be quite big, and you can also turn the swimming jets off and just soak. Ofuros: these were private wooden tubs filled with water heated by wood fires.</p>

There is probably no better way to enjoy your home environment with the people you love the most, than sharing the fun with some wonderful swim spa activities. And then there are the independent hot tub sales events which are not only paying thousands for their space and everything else mentioned above for a three-day event…but they have extremely high costs for their aggressive TV advertising campaign.</p>
<p>On the other end, a pair of powerful swim jets produce one of the smoothest swim currents in the industry, fully adjustable for any level swimmer, with a backlit buoyancy jet that illuminates the swim current and combines the perfect amount of air to elevate the swimmer into the ideal position.

<p>The latest hot tubs have superior ozone systems resulting in the use of much less chemicals. This open-concept tank is large enough to offer many of the benefits that swimming pools do. Often, companies that offer swimming pool cleaning services recommend lowering the water level for winterizing. Key questions to answer when shopping for a hot tub are how many people will be using it at one time, and where you plan to place your hot tub.</p>

<p>The three different kinds of containers used for hot tubs are wooden barrels, fibreglass whirlpools, or large bathtubs.

Above ground swim spas also have the added advantage of being portable, so that if you ever decide to move house, you can take your swim spa with you, enabling you to get the most out of your investment.</p>
<p>In this part of your swim spa, internal turbines create a current you can swim against, just as you would if you swam in the ocean tide; this gives you the optimal exercise of swimming as a form of strength training in a small, efficient area.
