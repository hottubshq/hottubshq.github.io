<p>Saunas have existed for thousands of years and are now being rediscovered the world over for their health and social benefits. The ancient Greeks and the Romans also all had a great love for communal hot baths fed by natural hot springs and many of these bath houses had massage facilities, sports arenas and places to eat included as well. This GFCI protection panel (Spa Pack) is to be not closer than 5 feet from the hot tub, yet within site of the unit no gates or walls (NEC 680.24 -B2b).
