<p>We all know the benefits of owning a swimming pool. Browse other J-300 models to experience additional spas with more jets or smaller tubs. Some swim spas, which are usually small in size, are not heated as much as hot tubs. From the perfect placement of PowerPro® Jets to the optimal positioning of the body in ergonomic seats, a Jacuzzi® Hot Tub delivers the ultimate hydrotherapy massage. Shopping for a hot tub or sauna can be a daunting task — especially if you haven't shopped for one before.</p>
<p>The Swim Collection is available in a Pool, Play, Performance, Wellness Spa® and Wellness Spa®X Series. EBay, the king of online auctions, typically has dozens of hot tub auctions running at any one time. It is a known fact that warm water helps not only to reduce stress, but also to ease sore muscles and aches. Completely adjustable current means everyone who uses the swim spa will find the perfect swimming speed.</p>
<p>In fact, most larger swim spas will even have a separate section that mimics a hot tub, offering a dual-purpose experience. Many agree that having a Jacuzzi walk-in tub has noticeably improved their quality of life. Their Simple hot tub Care®, system is an easy-to-follow program that is simple to use, but does for your hot tub exactly what needs to be done. Swim spas have it all—aquatic exercise, relaxation and fun for all ages from the comforts, privacy and convenience of home.</p>

Along with the great customer satisfaction that we have always strived to provide, now we also offer FREE water testing and filter cleaning by donation - along with FREE site checks for those interested in a new Arctic Spa or swimming pool. I have to say that this does sound pretty appealing but my suspicion is that they aren't all that comfortable and I would miss the luxury of the moving water and hydrotherapy aspects of the modern hot tub.</p>
<p>A cracked or damaged shell of a hot tub can be very costly or impossible to repair. One of the brothers, Roy Jacuzzi, invented the hot tub in 1968. With powerful massaging jets penetrating deep into the skin, slipping into a swim spa is the answer to instant rejuvenation after a long day, refreshing and revitalizing a tired body and mind. Some manufacturers use full-foam when they make their Hot Tubs and these are in my view and that of very large American manufacturers an old design as they need to be able to vent off the motor-generated heat to the outside air where of course the latent heat contained win in the unit is just simply wasted.</p>
