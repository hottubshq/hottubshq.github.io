On the other end, a pair of powerful swim jets produce one of the smoothest swim currents in the industry, fully adjustable for any level swimmer, with a backlit buoyancy jet that illuminates the swim current and combines the perfect amount of air to elevate the swimmer into the ideal position. Our collection of swim and fitness spas are the pinnacle of performance and style providing improved wellness and a better quality of life conveniently at home.</p>
<p>Water constantly passes over the steel tube creating a consistent and reliable heating pattern. One of the greater benefits that comes with a swim spa is in the form of efficiency and portability.

Many swim spas also offer the option of swim jets in addition to the hydrotherapy jets. Baths, swimming pools, jacuzzi are turned off 10 minutes to closing of the Aqua Park.</p>
<p>If you are looking to have a swimming pool and hot tub combination, a two tank swim spa might be your best option. Swim spas require a solid, level surface to sit on and an electrical supply line (usually 220 volt, similar to a hot tub). We believe the best way to deliver great service is to represent the number 1 hot tub brand in the world - Jacuzzi. In fact, some studies suggest aquatic exercise may be more effective than on-land workouts for some people with back ailments, according to an article by Rena Goldman in Pool & Spa News Like with osteoarthritis and bone and joints ailments, the secret here lies in the reduction of pressure on your joints provided by the buoyancy of the water.</p>

Since every policy is a little different in their treatment of hot tubs, make sure you check with your insurance provider or read your policy to make sure you understand the specifics of your coverage. It might even be called a spa as in the Lay zee spa brand in the UK, but, if it's freestanding, semi-permanent and has inbuilt filtration and heating then it's a hot tub.</p>
<p>We'll describe the average swim spa and compare that with both of the largest Hydropool models in the article below. Like all swimming pools, swim spa pools are available in a range of different sizes and shapes. The jets force out water into various points in the spa.
