<p>Even though swim spas are hugely beneficial from a health and wellness perspective, they suffer from one major drawback. Swim spas are not an ideal choice for families, as only one person can comfortably swim in a swim spa at any time. The Jacuzzi brand tradition of innovation in hydro-massage has made Jacuzzi the most desired product in whirlpool bathing. Our spas come with valuable customer and technical support for the lifetime of the spa.

<p>We've had hot tubs in the past and decided we wanted something simple this time. It is advisable for people suffering from diarrhea, skin infections, intestinal infections or fresh wounds on any part of the body not to use the hot tubs. The average price of Jacuzzi bathtubs are based on their size, whether the unit can still be used as a standup shower and the number of jets they include. The lining of the Jacuzzi tub or swim spa is usually made from fiberglass or acrylic.</p>
