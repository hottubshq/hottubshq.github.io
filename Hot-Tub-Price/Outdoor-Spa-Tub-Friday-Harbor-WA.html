<p>OK, class ~ it's time to define the true meaning of the different types of hot water therapy. Swim spas are covered by a thick insulated cover and are lined with an insulation of polyurethane, therefore the cost of running the unit is much less than that of a regular pool and, of course, even lower than the cost of operating both a pool and a hot tub. You do need to have the correct measurements if you plan to use one of these kits for building a swim spa or hot tub enclosure with a hot tub cover because all the materials are pre cut to the lengths that you need for the size of gazebo you choose.</p>
<p>Due to the fact that heat rises, it is the spa cover that contains this heat. We put family with a firm focus on kids at the forefront of our mind when we set about designing our range of swim spas. Before any piece of Jacuzzi® Pro Grade Pool Equipment leaves the factory, it is thoroughly tested in a state-of-the-art facility. Quality spas provide their owners with years of use and reliable performance. An H2X Fitness Swim Spa by Master Spas combines the benefits of water exercise with the therapy of a hot tub so you can own your wellness and win your day.</p>
<p>Your body opens up the blood vessels because it thinks you are getting too warm and the ones near the surface of the skin relax in an effort to release heat. In addition, we look for swim spa manufacturers that offer a variety of extras to enhance your swim spa experience, including spa covers, underwater workout equipment, sound systems, railings and LED lights. Best of all, it helps keep the Jacuzzi bathtub free of bacteria.</p>

<p>Quality tubs start at about $1,500, but depending on the added amenities, prices can climb as high as $5,000 or $6,000.

You can spend some time with your loved ones in this stress-free environment where you can relax together and catch up. Trying to swim spas with your close family members or friends could be fun and a new experience that will help you get closer to each other.</p>

<p>If you are looking to have a swimming pool and hot tub combination, a two tank swim spa might be your best option. Swim spas require a solid, level surface to sit on and an electrical supply line (usually 220 volt, similar to a hot tub). We believe the best way to deliver great service is to represent the number 1 hot tub brand in the world - Jacuzzi. In fact, some studies suggest aquatic exercise may be more effective than on-land workouts for some people with back ailments, according to an article by Rena Goldman in Pool & Spa News Like with osteoarthritis and bone and joints ailments, the secret here lies in the reduction of pressure on your joints provided by the buoyancy of the water.</p>

The number of motors and pumps is in direct relation to the actual size of the Hot Tub the number of jets and the degree of therapy delivered. Hydrotherapy is a therapeutic whole-body treatment that involves moving and exercising in water; essentially physiotherapy in a pool.</p>
<p>A basic model costs about $4,000, while more expensive swim spas, complete with custom features, cost upward of $30,000. Jacuzzi's alcove tubs are installed into a three-wall tiled niche, as the side No. 4 is either a shower curtain or glass shower door. With this you can swim and exercise in your swim spa and you don't even need a pool. Two of the most popular options are spa pools and plunge pools. At , we're proud to work with the leading name in whirlpool baths to stock a great selection of Jacuzzi baths to suit bathrooms big and small.</p>
<p>We provide this Double Seater Jacuzzi Bathtubon several designs & other related options as per the needs of customers. There are often more jets in an air jetted tub than there are in the water jetted tubs. Many people that suffer from such things as arthritis, obesity, physical disabilities, and even learning disabilities, have all been shown to greatly benefit from swimming pool and spa treatments. With technology advancing everyday, the design of the Jacuzzis started developing and now there are about 250 patents in all in the whirlpool bath and spa industry.</p>
