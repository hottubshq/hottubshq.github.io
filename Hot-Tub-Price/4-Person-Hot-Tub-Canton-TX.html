<p>Hot Tubs from the east usually have every accessory but not the one they really need a Skip!. Built with strong and durable materials, Jacuzzi spas will operate at a consistently high level, assuring you reliable, energy-efficient performance for years of worry-free hot tub enjoyment. What's more, if you combine stretching or water exercises with your time in the hot tub, you can enhance the pain relieving and healing benefits of your spa. Marquis' Ownership Protection Plan is simple to understand and completely outlines the coverage of your brand new Marquis Hot Tub.</p>
<p>The difference with swim spas is that they're often larger than a standard spa pool and have an open area at one end without seating. If an Extreme Lighting Package is installed on your spa, each corner will light up to match the color of light in your hot tub. When you allow the massaging jets to massage your sore spots or even just hold your feet up to the circulating massaging water you will immediately feel better and your feet won't hurt much at all.</p>
<p>A question we see often is, "How much do swim spas cost?"
