<p>Mums and Bubs swimming lesson sessions are designed for babies aged between 6 and 24 months. Many have what is known as thermal” spa facilities which basically means that there will be hydrotherapy pools, possibly steam rooms, ice caves, salt steam rooms, feature showers and maybe saunas at different temperatures.

If you swim seriously, swim jets are not ideal, as competitive swimming always takes place in natural conditions, so you will not gain a realistic idea of your times and progress if you are practising in a swim spa.

<p>One of the biggest benefits of a swim spa is that it can be used 365 days a year. One downside is that you cannot use bubble bath, bath oil or bath salts in a jetted tub with water jets. That offers the user finger tip control of the swim current from inside the swim area. We will first take a look at the benefits the swim spa can bring, on the fitness and relaxation side of things.
