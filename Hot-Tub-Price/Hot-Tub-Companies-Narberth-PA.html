Swim spas are not an ideal choice for families, as only one person can comfortably swim in a swim spa at any time. The Jacuzzi brand tradition of innovation in hydro-massage has made Jacuzzi the most desired product in whirlpool bathing.

If you do buy a second hot tub you will not of course have the many advantages that come with buying a new unit but you should perhaps ask for a limited guarantee from the vendor and if buying from a second hand dealer in Hot Tubs then you certainly in my view should get a limited guarantee of some kind.</p>
