<p>A Swim Spa is both a swimming pool and a spa or hot tub. Jacuzzi hot tub brings the health benefits relieves sree, improve your sleep, soothes muscles & joints. Most swim spas can be properly adjusted to cater for every style of swimming technique. Since 1995, Nordic has led the industry in providing high quality, therapeutic hot tubs. From pure relaxation to therapeutic, Massage Therapy will help drain the tension from your body and the stress from your mind. There is ample space for your daily swim and workout, and water circulates with ease.</p>
<p>With the burgeoning interest in health and leisure across the United States, yet another opportunity was spotted in the 1960s, by Roy Jacuzzi, who invented and marketed the first self-contained, fully-integrated whirlpool bath, creating a whole new industry almost on his own. In short, hot tubs and Jacuzzis are not the same. Tests have proven that through having a heat pump within your spa pool or swim spa, running costs are reduced by over 50%, resulting in shortened and achievable payback period.</p>

Exercise pools allow you to exercise harder and work your body in a different ways than swimming laps in a regular sized pool. Spending time in a swim spa can even help improve your mental and emotional health. Just like in the case of hot tubs, keep well-hydrated and get out as soon as you experience any sign of discomfort.</p>

Wooden hot tubs are still used in some spas and resorts, for the special touch they enhance the interior design with a certain "je ne sai quois" reminding us of long-forgotten times when there were no modern bathrooms and people had to bath in wooden tubs.</p>
<p>This flexibility has allowed thousands of people to realize the dream of "endless" swimming at their own home. Quite simply, a Swim Spa is a machine that allows you to swim continuously against a water current. During the mid-2000's, a few keen hot tub manufacturers saw that there might be a larger market opening up in the Swim Spa industry, and a number of them changed their production lines to also produce the larger, more bulky Swim Spas.</p>
<p>Clearwater Spas Filtration System cleans the entire body of water. 806 winter hot tubs stock photos, vectors, and illustrations are available royalty-free. The design features five jets - three on top for resistance and two underneath for lift - that create a smooth, air-free current for superior low-impact, total-body exercise. Look for a swim spa that insulates both the water in the swim spa and the outer cabinet.</p>
