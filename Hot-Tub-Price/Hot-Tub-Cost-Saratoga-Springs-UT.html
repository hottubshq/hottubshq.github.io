<p>I have been asked this question by so many customers. Embrace the ultimate aquatic workout experience with a Swim Pro Swim & Fitness Spa. You can find more in-depth information on the benefits of whirlpool baths and discover whether a whirlpool bath is the right choice for you. As the Jacuzzi brand became more famous, people started referring to a hot tub as a jacuzzi. I would not buy a Jacuzzi Hot Tub if the majority of the jets were unadjustable for one thing they can be painful.</p>
<p>And some hot tubs have too high a level of chemicals. Buoyancy-simulating Levitator Jets are angled upwards toward the swimmer to replicate the natural buoyancy that would be present as you swim in open water. The wooden tub looks a bit like an oversized wine barrel and needs a permanent platform to stand on. The wooden spa is heated by fire, is better outside and needs a fair bit of maintenance to keep it in good working order.</p>
<p>So these many jets (not that many really) simply do not have enough power to actually make these Jets perform properly, So for performance in a Hot Tub it is just not a simple question of the number of Jets but it does come down to things like engineering and design and the balance of the Jets with the correct motors and water pumps to produce the better all round product More often than not, these Hot Tubs with lower rated motors have to have a diverter valve fitted so that other parts of the spa can be turned off to get any decent power where one is actually sitting.</p>

<p>Swim Spas are smaller than typical swimming pools and this makes them much easier to drain for cleaning and maintenance.

They are often installed in houses as a replacement for a regular bathtub.
