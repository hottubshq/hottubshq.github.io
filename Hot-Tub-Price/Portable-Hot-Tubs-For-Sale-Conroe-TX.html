<p>3. Length of time in business - If a company started manufacturing 2 years ago and is offering a 10 year warranty, even they cannot be sure that the spa will last for it's warranty period. Hot tubs and saunas are a great way to relax after a long day and both have been proven to provide several health benefits. Some Swim Spa units have just one body of water. This involves a considerable amount of extra work, however, as the ground in your backyard will have to be excavated before the installation can take place, just like it would with a regular inground swimming pool.</p>
