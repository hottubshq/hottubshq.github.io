<p>Swimming accessories are important for summer safety if you plan on swimming. With Jacuzzi for Life, you have the option of purchasing any 300, 400, 500 or LX series hot tub. Innovative jet pump & equipment technology and newer manufacturing methods made the cost of production of the Swim Spa to come down to the levels of a high quality portable hot tub. The biggest factor to consider in terms of cost is the price of the Jacuzzi bathtub itself. Many people ask themselves if it's worth it to invest in a swim spa.</p>
<p>Don't forget to check out the plethora of hot tub accessories available on Wayfair that will only add to your hot tub experience. The faster the filters can clean the water , the less the swim spa will need to run when you're not using it. We liked the hard top cover and simplicity of the Eco Spas.

The best advice is that you should see any used hot tub jacuzzi in full working action before you agree to buy it. If, when you go to see it and it is empty of water or is disconnected from the electricity then you should obviously arrange for another visit or wait for it to be reconnected and filled up with water, and turned on.</p>
