<p>When people just state that a hot tub is a hot tub and they are all the same, I get really frustrated because they are not all the same and now I will show you why. Our innovative use of LED has changed the way spa pools are being lit. You certainly can relax more effectively in your hot tub when you keep those custom spa covers in place when you are not actively using your spa or hot tub.

Once inside your Italian Design hot tub, you can indulge in the ultimate hydrotherapy massage - whilst from the outside, you can indulge your senses in truly iconic design.</p>
<p>The drastic price difference while having the same benefits give swim spas an advantage over the other options. There are Hot tub on the marketplace now that are designed for two people only; therefore the tubs are much smaller to the traditional larger hot tubs. These smaller sized swim spas can still accommodate several bathers, although if you're taller than average it might feel a little small. Another great characteristic that comes with owning a swim spa is that its maintenance is so much easier then it would be with owning a swimming pool.</p>
<p>Indoor hot tubs offer many conveniences that can't be found with outdoor tubs. If you are able to use a gas heater or heat pump (which offers savings of up to 75%). This bathtub exceeded my expectations. They say that swimmers are more prone to dehydration because it causes high levels of exertion in the body, but swimmers do not feel the urge to drink because they are immersed within the water and therefore the brain is not aware of the need for water, and other liquids.</p>
