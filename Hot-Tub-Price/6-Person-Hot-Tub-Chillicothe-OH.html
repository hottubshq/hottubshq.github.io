<p>A lot of people ask what is the difference between a swim spa and a swimming pool? When you install your hot tub or pool you may or may not have used conduit or a duct that is buried in your garden for protecting the cables, if there is spare capacity, you can feed your power and cable leads through the duct to the location normally on a wall near the pool or hot tub. While some spas still use wooden tubs, there are many private spas that use specially designed hot tubs and whirlpools to create a relaxing atmosphere for their clients while still using the healing power of warm water.</p>
<p>Our new jetted swim current lets you exercise with gentle resistance, and then unwind in ergonomically sculpted hydromassage seats. The photo to the left shows the hot tub spa area of an all-in-one Swim Spa unit. You don't need to have the jets or blowers on - there is nothing like laying in your own hot tub, with just your head poking out of the water, watching the sun go down. With a swim spa at home, the incredible benefits of aquatic fitness are delivered right to your doorstep—no traveling, monthly gym membership or navigating a crowded pool filled with strangers.</p>
<p>In fact, most larger swim spas will even have a separate section that mimics a hot tub, offering a dual-purpose experience. Many agree that having a Jacuzzi walk-in tub has noticeably improved their quality of life. Their Simple hot tub Care®, system is an easy-to-follow program that is simple to use, but does for your hot tub exactly what needs to be done. Swim spas have it all—aquatic exercise, relaxation and fun for all ages from the comforts, privacy and convenience of home.</p>
