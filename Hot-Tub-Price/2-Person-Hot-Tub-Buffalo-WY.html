While budget swim spas promise a lesser financial burden initially, much more can go wrong if inferior materials and unskilled labor are used.

In almost all cases the pumps and pipework are all contained under the bath so space shouldn't be a problem unless you're looking for a larger bath. Our friendly staff members are extremely knowledgeable about all variations of Australian swim spas, plunge pools and hot tubs for sale at competitive prices.</p>
