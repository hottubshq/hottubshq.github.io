<p>One of the biggest benefits of a swim spa is that it can be used 365 days a year. One downside is that you cannot use bubble bath, bath oil or bath salts in a jetted tub with water jets. That offers the user finger tip control of the swim current from inside the swim area. We will first take a look at the benefits the swim spa can bring, on the fitness and relaxation side of things. If you're pregnant or you have a health condition like heart disease, ask your doctor if it's safe for you to get into a hot tub.</p>
<p>This is a spa that is offered at a fitness club or a recreational club as an added facility. Unlike a swimming pool which can be quite costly to install and requires a large backyard, swim spas offer this all-in-one portable package in a box that can be craned into position in an hour. If you plan to heat your swim spa regularly, especially the swim end due to the large amount of water, you need to be able to use a gas or a heat pump as the electric heaters will be very expensive.</p>
