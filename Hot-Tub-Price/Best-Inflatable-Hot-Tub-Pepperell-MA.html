<p>When people just state that a hot tub is a hot tub and they are all the same, I get really frustrated because they are not all the same and now I will show you why. Our innovative use of LED has changed the way spa pools are being lit. You certainly can relax more effectively in your hot tub when you keep those custom spa covers in place when you are not actively using your spa or hot tub.

Once inside your Italian Design hot tub, you can indulge in the ultimate hydrotherapy massage - whilst from the outside, you can indulge your senses in truly iconic design.</p>
<p>In case you need something much bigger, SwimEx makes the 1000 S - a multi-user swim spa that holds 7,700 gallons of water. Besides the usual Jacuzzi jets of water, the entire pool looked like the wake of the QE2. If you are looking for the best quality hot tub for your family, Jacuzzi is the brand for you. In fact, Jacuzzi is a trademarked brand of hot tubs, bath products and pool equipment. Swimming is a well-known way to achieve weight loss, so with the right training regime, a swim spa should definitely be able to help you if you're looking to get slimmer.</p>
<p>A pool spa is used for people who have plenty of room in their yard and who want the best of both worlds for their swimming and relaxation pleasure. If you don't have kids or plan to only use your spa for swimming and exercise, a one tank spa might work out better.

This company has five lines of swim spas: AquaPlay, AquaTrainer, ExecutiveTrainer, AquaSport and ExecutiveSport.</p>
