A jump in pH can cause the water to become alkaline and cloudy, leading to scale build up in your spa.

The insulation around the cabinet traps in waste heat created by the pumps and heater, greatly increasing the energy efficiency of the swim spa as a whole.</p>

<p>Your swim spa should be heat pump ready” and you should try and buy a swim spa with a heat pump compatible controller.
