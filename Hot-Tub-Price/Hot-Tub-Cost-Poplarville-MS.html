<p>Welcome to TidalFit — the answer to swimming, aquatic fitness and soothing massage in one. During this time, I continued to watch the growth and increase in popularity of free standing, self-contained swim spas, however, the quality and performance of these spas simply did not meet my standards and expectations.
