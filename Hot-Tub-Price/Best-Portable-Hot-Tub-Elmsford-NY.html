<p>Riptide swim spas and exercise pools delivered and installed by our experienced team. Hot water is a great way to keep the body moving. A Jacuzzi soaking tub is the most common type of tub, and this basic concept is Jacuzzi's foundation for hydrotherapy tubs. Some hot tubs also come with features that Jacuzzi products do not, such as flat-screen TVs and built-in MP3 audio systems. Our Swim Spa River Jets are each powered solely by a 4 HP (6BHP) Hyper Flow Jet Pump. Having the swim spa completely above ground is another option that allows you to fence only the steps (as long as the swim spa is over 1200mm high the height of pool fencing).</p>
<p>It is important to note, though, that the overall size of a swim spa is different from the amount of usable swimming space it contains. Most swim spas found in Canada fall into the mid-range category; costing between $20,000-$35,000. Your swim spa will be the perfect outlet for relaxation, leisure, fun with family. The temperature in an unheated walk-in tub drops to 98.6 in 10 minutes, requiring the bather to add more hot water to remain comfortable.</p>
<p>This new and innovative way to take your swim spa cover on and off makes swim spa sessions easier than ever. Jacuzzi developed the first hot tub pump 60 years ago and continues to provide innovative hydrotherapy products and features. For the ultimate in relaxation, a whirlpool bath is absolutely ideal for easing muscle tension & improving blood circulation, and now it's even easier to upgrade than ever. Be sure when ordering an Aqua Flow Viton seal kit that it will match the pump used in your Cal Spa, Marquis, Clearwater, Coleman or other spa brand that from time to time has used Aqua Flo pumps in their spas.</p>

<p>Adding a Vortex Hybrid Heat Pump to your spa will give you the lowest possible heating costs.

They're also great for socializing, since you don't need to run the swimming jets all the time.</p>
<p>Hot tubs are a wonderful excuse for getting out in the garden more often, and with care they can be designed to blend into their surroundings so they don't stick out as an eyesore. Because of this, all spas that use an ozone system should also include a mixing chamber that ensures ozone receives the correct contact time with the water. Eco Spas offers a line of spas that are compact, reasonably priced with an extremely durable shell and cover.</p>

<p>The drastic price difference while having the same benefits give swim spas an advantage over the other options. There are Hot tub on the marketplace now that are designed for two people only; therefore the tubs are much smaller to the traditional larger hot tubs. These smaller sized swim spas can still accommodate several bathers, although if you're taller than average it might feel a little small. Another great characteristic that comes with owning a swim spa is that its maintenance is so much easier then it would be with owning a swimming pool.</p>

This Jacuzzi bathtub is the easiest way of bringing lavishness and grace with elegance to your lifestyle. This is a self-contained Swim Spa that has been set on the ground and then had a wood deck built around it. Notice that the body of water is all together (not separated into two areas).</p>
<p>A cracked or damaged shell of a hot tub can be very costly or impossible to repair. One of the brothers, Roy Jacuzzi, invented the hot tub in 1968. With powerful massaging jets penetrating deep into the skin, slipping into a swim spa is the answer to instant rejuvenation after a long day, refreshing and revitalizing a tired body and mind. Some manufacturers use full-foam when they make their Hot Tubs and these are in my view and that of very large American manufacturers an old design as they need to be able to vent off the motor-generated heat to the outside air where of course the latent heat contained win in the unit is just simply wasted.</p>
<p>Environmental reasons for spa & hot tub odors are due to the build-up of bio-films on spa surfaces and plumbing lines that contribute to the formation of White Water Mold and Pink Slime and all of their odors. Jacuzzi® Brand hot tub owners in the GTA, Kitchener, Barrie and London are provided with a world-class hot tub ownership experience - for life.

Thus, you can consider swimming at the beach instead of swimming in a swimming pool. 6. Number of jets versus number of pumps-Your average spa water pump should support a maximum of 30 jets.
