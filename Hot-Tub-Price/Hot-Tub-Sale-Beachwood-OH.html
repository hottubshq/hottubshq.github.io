<p>Hot tub pumps are critical for any spa. The American Bath Factory Champagne Jester Jetted Rolltop is a great example of the functionality of jetted bathtubs.

Swim spas can be used for many types of exercise, beyond the invigorating workouts you get swimming against the resistance current. In contrast to a typical bathtub , a hot tub is designed to be used by more than one person at a time, with many models accommodating four or more people. There are many companies that carry jetted tubs, some of the most well known include American Standard and Whirlpool bathtubs.</p>
