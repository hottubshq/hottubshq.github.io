<p>Hydrotherapy and Jacuzzi hot tubs seem to go hand and hand these days. The Endless Pools Fitness Systems shell has a modern style with clean lines that flow gracefully from end to end. Built from the highest quality acrylic, Endless Pools swim spas are designed to provide years of family fun and enjoyment. The Jacuzzi brother's patent ran out 10 years later in 1976 which lead to the American hot tub market taking off as they were able to use the Jacuzzi type jets. The original hydrotherapy jet was invented by the Jacuzzi® brothers in 1956.</p>
<p>Endless Pools was one of the first companies to develop the Swim Spa concept years ago. By taking the added stress of maintenance, repairs and replacement out of owning a hot tub, Jacuzzi for Life provides customers in Hamilton, Burlington and surrounding areas with the best experience available on the market. However, rather than focusing on a name, your hot tub purchase should be based on the quality and features that fit your budget and desires.</p>

If you swim seriously, swim jets are not ideal, as competitive swimming always takes place in natural conditions, so you will not gain a realistic idea of your times and progress if you are practising in a swim spa. Whether you decided on the built-in model or installing a swim spa in your garden, the cost of installation is much less than constructing an in-ground swimming pool that requires a lot of labor work to get done.</p>
