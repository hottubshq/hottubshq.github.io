Swim spas usually only have seating at one end with 2 or 4 powerful swim jets at the other.

Some manufacturers use full-foam when they make their Hot Tubs and these are in my view and that of very large American manufacturers an old design as they need to be able to vent off the motor-generated heat to the outside air where of course the latent heat contained win in the unit is just simply wasted.</p>
