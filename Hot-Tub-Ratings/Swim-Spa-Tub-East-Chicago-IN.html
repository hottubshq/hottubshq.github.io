<p>How to design for a Jacuzzi in your house. The Hydrozone Plunge has no swim jets and two pumps. Our decision was based on expert knowledge, common sense advice regarding running costs, information about water cleanliness and about the necessary foundations for the product, delivery and set up and of course on the significant therapeutic benefits the spa will offer to my husband. Arctic Spas® has solutions for these valid concerns with our FreeHeat and Spa Boy® technology greatly lowering your monthly energy costs and to help maintain ideal spa conditions.</p>
<p>Today Jacuzzis are normally found in residential homes, hotels suites, aboard cruise ships, and in the spas sprinkled in all parts of the world. The intensity and direction of the hydromassages, the water temperature regulation and the jets number are managed through a digital control board for the hydrotherapy to be efficient. You want the very latest in design whereby the Jets provide a vigorous massage to loosen those tight knotted muscles and at the same time increase the blood and oxygen circulation which helps to bring nutrients to sore muscles and joints.</p>
<p>In the sea most people spend some time splashing about to cool off as well as swimming, which also has benefits on your health. Compared to a swimming pool a swim spa requires much less space in your home or garden, yet despite the smaller footprint provides even the strongest swimmer a fantastic swimming experiences all year round. At the same time, water is drawn out, filtered, reheated and cycled back in.</p>
