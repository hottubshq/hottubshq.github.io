The relaxation of a swim spa in unbelievable, you get the benefits of a hot tub and a fitness pool all in one. On the other hand, the harsh chemicals of the water can lead to dry, irritated skin if they aren't rinsed away when the whirlpool session is through. The CDC says people catch recreational water illnesses” by swallowing, breathing in mists or aerosols of, or having contact with contaminated water” in everything from pools and hot tubs to natural sources such as lakes and rivers.</p>
<p>It is recommended that a whirlpool bathtub be cleaned at least twice a month. Swim Spas also act as smaller swimming pools in the sense that you can play around in them, or with some of the split-models, you actually have a hot tub spa in one end of it and a swimming area in the other end. Regularly have a professional check your spa or hot tub and make sure it is in good, safe working condition, and that drain covers are in place and not cracked or missing.</p>
<p>The warm water inside the tub can relax spasms, alleviate sprains, backache, and fatigue. This allow you to run your heat pump from your spa controller (not via a separate touchpad), use both heat pump AND electric heater for extra fast heating and extends the life of the heat pump. The heat eases out the tension built up in the muscles and increases the blood flow, which in turn heals the body.
