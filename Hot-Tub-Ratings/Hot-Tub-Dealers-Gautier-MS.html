<p>Hot Tubs are a fantastic accessory to have in your garden or conservatory, to be able to have a hot steaming hot tub ready for you and your partner to unwind when every you want so you are able to soak away all your tension and tired muscles. Since private pools are used exclusively by a few people, these swimming pools are usually smaller than public pools. Spa and hot tub water therapies are highly valued for their relaxing, rejuvenating, and naturally rehabilitative qualities, and hot tubs remain a favorite social setting. Our standard wood-fired hot tubs are equipped with NO jets and filters. Some people like a little bit of texture that gives you a feel similar to that of an in ground hot tub.</p>
<p>In general, swim spas tend to cost more than hot tubs of comparable size, although that varies depending on such things as the number of jets and other amenities. Some love the flexibility that a swim spa provides, while others are after the many features they offer. If you want to feel relaxed by pleasuring in the warm waters after an entire day of work, then you should install Jacuzzi in your bathroom to feel completely relaxed.</p>
<p>In the sea most people spend some time splashing about to cool off as well as swimming, which also has benefits on your health. Compared to a swimming pool a swim spa requires much less space in your home or garden, yet despite the smaller footprint provides even the strongest swimmer a fantastic swimming experiences all year round. At the same time, water is drawn out, filtered, reheated and cycled back in.</p>

<p>Compared to a pool, the ratio of people to volume of water is drastically different to in a spa, prompting unexpected spikes in pH. A jump in pH can cause the water to become alkaline and cloudy, leading to scale build up in your spa. In addition, swimming can be great for runners recovering from injuries since it not only helps maintain good physical health but also improves mental health. The insulation around the cabinet traps in waste heat created by the pumps and heater, greatly increasing the energy efficiency of the swim spa as a whole.</p>

Even if you don't add a heat pump when buying your swim spa, make sure this technology and plumbing is in place as an option down the track.

<p>Experience the heated-water hydrotherapy and jetted hydromassage benefits of a hot tub, with the increased hydrostatic-pressure benefits of a swim spa. Sure, the waters were colder than I usually like, and my body had to endure a bit of punishment it's not accustomed to (plus, there's shrinkage), but the thrill generated by the competition convinced me that adding open water swims to my racing repertoire is a definite must.</p>
