<p>The hot tub is an attractive and strong focal point when added as a new feature in a home. The Indulgence swim spa is the top of the line for us at Sunbelt Spas. Although ABS based acrylic has proven strength, fibreglass is still sometimes added in order to ensure it maintains its strength alongside supporting the spas water and bather load. When your bathroom space is limited, a corner tub can give you the most out of the space. The next big leap forward came when the Jacuzzi brothers hydrotherapy pump was combined with fibreglass bodywork, a filtration system and electric heating system to create what is essentially the modern day hot tub.</p>
<p>The customers experience the mixture of water with air that keeps them relaxed and relieves from all tensions and body aches. You need to make this decision before you start shopping as it will determine what you will need to spend, the power requirements of the spa you need and the quality of your swim spa experience. Keep in mind that the figures above do not include set up, break down, electricity, water, insurance, commissions, hotel and airfare (for flown in professional sales people).</p>
<p>So these many jets (not that many really) simply do not have enough power to actually make these Jets perform properly, So for performance in a Hot Tub it is just not a simple question of the number of Jets but it does come down to things like engineering and design and the balance of the Jets with the correct motors and water pumps to produce the better all round product More often than not, these Hot Tubs with lower rated motors have to have a diverter valve fitted so that other parts of the spa can be turned off to get any decent power where one is actually sitting.</p>

<p>The IX Jet merges maximum airflow with high-output LED lighting, sending multicolored champagne-like bubbles from the bottom of the hot tub to the surface.

<p>Vortex dual layer system keeps the heat from the pumps and plumbing, reduces noise and provides a warm layer between the water and the outside of the spa. The circulation pump, jet pump(s) and electronic control system of all Vortex swim spas are warranted against defects for 2 years. Friends and family can enjoy a pleasant time soaking in the warm water and chatting. You do have to be cautious about the quality of used hot tubs.</p>

<p>Many different styles of corner tubs are available, including taller and deeper tubs (much like soaking tubs) give you a full body bath in a quarter of the space (length x width), and it utilizes the often ample space in height in many bathrooms.

You should always check that all the pumps and blowers are working and that the heater control lights indicate that the heater is on when the spa is calling for heat.</p>

Jacuzzi still to this day continues to innovate & lead the hot tub industry forward. One of the most overlooked areas in a swimspa is the ability of the unit to provide benefits outside the swim and massage.</p>

Most swim spas sold in Canada will set you back between $10,000 and $50,000 CAD. Steamy hot tubs can also pose a risk of Legionnaires' disease , a type of pneumonia caused by Legionella bacteria. Wooden hot tubs are still used in some spas and resorts, for the special touch they enhance the interior design with a certain "je ne sai quois" reminding us of long-forgotten times when there were no modern bathrooms and people had to bath in wooden tubs.</p>
