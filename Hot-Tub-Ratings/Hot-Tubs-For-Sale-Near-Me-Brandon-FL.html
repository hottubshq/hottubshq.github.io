<p>Dehydration or hypohydration refers to the loss of water within the body. Given its background, the options that Jacuzzi offers elevates bathing from a cleaning session to a bathing experience you'd find in a spa. Relax with massaging spa jets in the perfect water temperature, year-round. The self-cleaning option helps keep the jets and the tubing that runs throughout the Jacuzzi bathtub clean.

Spas should also have a diverter valve to maintain water pressure on 1 or 2 seats.</p>
