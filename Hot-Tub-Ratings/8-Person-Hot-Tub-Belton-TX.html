<p>When people refer to a hot tub or a spa, they often think of the word Jacuzzi. When you exercise in one of these spas, you will be utilizing every muscle group in your body in a controlled setting. Given that the skill level to install a Jacuzzi bathtub is fairly high, most homeowners hire a pro. It produces a certain water current that allows you to swim there for as long as you want without hitting any walls. We had a jacuzzi tub in our old home and the jets never seemed clean no matter what I tried.</p>
<p>Take your soaking experience to the next level by adding Jacuzzi® Epsom Salt to your bathing ritual. Some swimming pool cleaning services experts recommend reducing pump operation to one hour per day until normal filtration cycle time is reached. Swim, exercise and relax with friends and family from the comforts and convenience of home. With multiple pumps you also get more and stronger massage jets as you can divert the water from the swim jets to the massage seats when you are not swimming.</p>
<p>It is best to run the water tests everyday to ensure the purity of the hot-tub water. No swimming pool experience would be complete without room for water toys. All Vortex Swim Spas have topside recesses to place your glasses and bottles. Even if you don't feel comfortable doing this in a showroom where the hot tubs are for sale, you should get into the shell and test the comfort level of the seats. Remember that swim spas are mechanical products and like a car you'll need replacement parts from time to time.</p>
