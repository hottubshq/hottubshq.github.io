Swim spas are covered by a thick insulated cover and are lined with an insulation of polyurethane, therefore the cost of running the unit is much less than that of a regular pool and, of course, even lower than the cost of operating both a pool and a hot tub. You do need to have the correct measurements if you plan to use one of these kits for building a swim spa or hot tub enclosure with a hot tub cover because all the materials are pre cut to the lengths that you need for the size of gazebo you choose.</p>
<p>Not to mention, most swim spas, especially the ones from Hydropool, come fully-equipped with a powerful jetting system. The proper use of hot tub covers will prevent accidental drowning and even some accidents such as an animal leaping into the spa and not being able to get out.
