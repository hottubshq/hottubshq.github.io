<p>When considering the purchase of a hot tub, the price is not the only factor that you should take into consideration. Experience Michael Phelps Signature Series Swim Spas by Master Spas. If you are going to heat your spa - as the larger the spa the more water you have to heat. Customers that visit our store after having purchased from one of these Super Duper Spa Shows” are flabbergasted to find that they could have purchased a better quality, name brand spa from Amazon Hot Tubs for less than they paid at the show; quality brands like Jacuzzi®, Hot Spring®, and American Whirlpool®, just to name a few.</p>
<p>Today Jacuzzis are normally found in residential homes, hotels suites, aboard cruise ships, and in the spas sprinkled in all parts of the world. The intensity and direction of the hydromassages, the water temperature regulation and the jets number are managed through a digital control board for the hydrotherapy to be efficient. You want the very latest in design whereby the Jets provide a vigorous massage to loosen those tight knotted muscles and at the same time increase the blood and oxygen circulation which helps to bring nutrients to sore muscles and joints.</p>
<p>The warm water inside the tub can relax spasms, alleviate sprains, backache, and fatigue. This allow you to run your heat pump from your spa controller (not via a separate touchpad), use both heat pump AND electric heater for extra fast heating and extends the life of the heat pump. The heat eases out the tension built up in the muscles and increases the blood flow, which in turn heals the body. With 60 years of experience in manufacturing and a legacy of quality products, you can trust that Jacuzzi® understands quality and is focused on customer satisfaction.</p>
