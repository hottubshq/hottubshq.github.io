<p>If you want a bathtub that can double as a place to wash your body, as well as soak and relax, you will want to consider jetted bathtubs, or the more common name, whirlpool tub. But spa” is also used as the American term for a hot tub equipped with strong jets that mix air into the water for a more pronounced massage effect. The point is this, if you spend a little time in your hot tub and get yourself to the point where you really enjoy this time, then you are doing much better than becoming addicted to pain killers.
