<p>Some cheap Hot Tubs which are usually cheap imports from the East claim to have many Jets but many times there are just simple pin point Jets, which do not rotate, or cross fire and are un-adjustable and in my view not really worth having but can look very enticing to a prospective purchaser. The best advice is that you should see any used hot tub jacuzzi in full working action before you agree to buy it. If, when you go to see it and it is empty of water or is disconnected from the electricity then you should obviously arrange for another visit or wait for it to be reconnected and filled up with water, and turned on.</p>
<p>A proper insulated cover is essential for a Hot Tub whether it is indoors or outside. Jacuzzi's Whisper+ technology features a patented pump system that absorbs half of the vibrations and cuts the tub's heating and pump systems sounds in half.
