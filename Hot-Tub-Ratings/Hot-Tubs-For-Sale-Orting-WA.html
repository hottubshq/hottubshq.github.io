<p>I have been asked this question by so many customers. Therefore, to enjoy your jacuzzi tub safely without any fear of electrical hazards, you should hire the services of an experienced electrical contractor for installing a hot tub and circuit breaker. Keep in mind your intended use before you spend the money on a spa or hot tub.

<p>So these many jets (not that many really) simply do not have enough power to actually make these Jets perform properly, So for performance in a Hot Tub it is just not a simple question of the number of Jets but it does come down to things like engineering and design and the balance of the Jets with the correct motors and water pumps to produce the better all round product More often than not, these Hot Tubs with lower rated motors have to have a diverter valve fitted so that other parts of the spa can be turned off to get any decent power where one is actually sitting.</p>
