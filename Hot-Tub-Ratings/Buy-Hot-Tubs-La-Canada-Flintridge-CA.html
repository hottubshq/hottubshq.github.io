Nowadays, the one-piece hot tubs are also quite common and have many advantages as well.</p>
<p>The drastic price difference while having the same benefits give swim spas an advantage over the other options. There are Hot tub on the marketplace now that are designed for two people only; therefore the tubs are much smaller to the traditional larger hot tubs. These smaller sized swim spas can still accommodate several bathers, although if you're taller than average it might feel a little small. Another great characteristic that comes with owning a swim spa is that its maintenance is so much easier then it would be with owning a swimming pool.</p>
<p>Hot tubs produce extreme heat as well as high humidity so your hot tub needs to be placed in a well ventilated area of your home. The two main types of swim spas - single zone” swim spas with one large swim area, and dual zone” swim spas - with separate spa and swim areas to allow you to have a different temperature in your spa and pool.

Some Sapphire spas have seats full of jets that we've positioned to target problem areas of the back, neck, and shoulders.
