The benefits of hydrotherapy, whether in a swimming pool, or in a spa, are wide-spread.</p>

And just like its namesake, great performance is exactly what you'll experience with the Michael Phelps Legend Series hot tub.</p>

They are often installed in houses as a replacement for a regular bathtub.

<p>Besides scrubbing down your Jacuzzi every so often, you must make sure all water is removed from the jetted tub after each use. In this way the water is directed to all the parts of the body and provides the massage. Today spas are frequently attached to hotels and sports complexes and come in a variety of different sizes and configurations. Draining & refilling of your spa or hot tub on a regular basis is the simplest, single best thing you can do to control odors.</p>
<p>In a Whirlpool bath you can direct the jets to specific muscles in your leg or back or wherever you're feeling tight. From our design engineers in California to our tradespeople in Georgia, we take pride in carrying on the Jacuzzi® legacy of quality. In the event of an injury, soaking in a hot tub may reduce recovery time since the increased blood circulation is bringing more blood to the injured area, resulting in faster healing.</p>
<p>Turn on the jets and the pulsating water massages the skin, increasing blood flow even more.
