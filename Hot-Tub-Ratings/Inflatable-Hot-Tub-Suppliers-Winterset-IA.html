<p>Nothing feels quite so good after a physical workout - or even just after a hard day at the office - than sinking into a nice hot tub(HT) and feeling those jet sprays pulsing against the skin. If you're planning on using it into Fall and Winter, you're going to want to make sure that your new swim spa is well insulated to reduce heating costs.

The reason for this is because this elongated part is the swimming pool part. If your Jacuzzi bathtub comes with a built-in filtration and water purification system, maintaining your hot tub should be a breeze.

That's huge, and the implications of the study are equally enormous, which of course means that if you don't have, or have access to an exercise poor or swimming spa, then you should seriously consider it, if you're interested in optimal health.</p>
