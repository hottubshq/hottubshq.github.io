<p>Family owned Sacramento dealer offering affordable high quality Turbo Spas and Swim Spas. You are probably thinking, Yeah, this sounds great, but it probably costs like a trillion dollars.” That is a common misconception about Swim Spas…that they are only for the fabulously wealthy. Illumatherapy also offers four points of entry, with two on each side of the tub, and air bubbles spraying from the jets give the appearance of dancing as they reflect the light. The blowers make the hot tub feel like you've got your own personal geyser - forcing air from the bottom of the pool, and creating a very relaxing environment for you.</p>

<p>Your body opens up the blood vessels because it thinks you are getting too warm and the ones near the surface of the skin relax in an effort to release heat. In addition, we look for swim spa manufacturers that offer a variety of extras to enhance your swim spa experience, including spa covers, underwater workout equipment, sound systems, railings and LED lights. Best of all, it helps keep the Jacuzzi bathtub free of bacteria.</p>
<p>Hotels and resorts have public pools as part of their recreational facilities for their guests. It is commonly said, "where the head goes, the body follow." The swimmer eye should look down and out while submerged, allows water to flow more easily over the head and reduces frontal resistance.

<p>Multiple conditioning grills smooth and redirect the water, resulting in a swim current that is free of turbulence. Jacuzzi designed the CLEARRAY water purification system, which uses an exclusive ultraviolet light filter to remove bacteria from your spa water.

<p>Swimming pools used for competitions are usually found indoors and heated to allow usage anytime of the year and to more easily fulfill with the regulations regarding temperature, lighting, and equipment. Make sure when you drain and refill your tub that you use a true spa cleaning solution and let the jets run for 20-30 minutes, if not longer, before draining. Another little-publicized benefit is that swim spa workouts can help people improve their balance, according to another 2018 article by Rick McAvoy.</p>
