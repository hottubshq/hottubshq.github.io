<p>How to design for a Jacuzzi in your house. The Hydrozone Plunge has no swim jets and two pumps.

<p>Other things to consider when thinking about adding a spa to your home are things like where is the water supply coming from, how heavy will it be and can it be supported, and also you need to take into consideration how many people may be using it.
