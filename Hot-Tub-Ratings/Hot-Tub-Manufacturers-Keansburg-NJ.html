<p>Water remains calm in a swimming pool, which can encourage walking or standing over a more active swimming experience. Just outside the back door, you can have an amazing temperature controlled pool and hot tub in one - the perfect space for light aquatic exercise followed by rejuvenation and allover relaxation. If the hot water jets are on, sit on the opposite side where the water temperature is slightly lower.</p>
