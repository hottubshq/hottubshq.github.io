<p>For the care of the body we rely on Jacuzzi company that for over 5 decades of experience, research and innovation, offers hot tub for the pure wellness, to be joyfully shared with others. One of the most important Jacuzzi tub accessories is the motor that helps run the jets. Our Swim Spa Suite is the perfect option, as it offers the best physical therapy and romantic therapy all wrapped up in one economical spa package. Most swim spas take up less space than traditional small in-ground pools. A hot tub is (usually) a round wooden tank with a simple bench seat and 4-8 jets around the side. The Great Backyard Place also recommends you give plenty of thought to where you want to put the hot tub or swim spa you buy.</p>
<p>In general, swim spas tend to cost more than hot tubs of comparable size, although that varies depending on such things as the number of jets and other amenities. Some love the flexibility that a swim spa provides, while others are after the many features they offer. If you want to feel relaxed by pleasuring in the warm waters after an entire day of work, then you should install Jacuzzi in your bathroom to feel completely relaxed.</p>
<p>These hot tubs are sometimes called Jacuzzi or Whirlpool tubs, though these are actually brand names. Leisurescape Pools & Spas stock a great variety of swim spas. A hot tub pump is made up of two sections. Two 5hp SwimBoost Pumps producing up to 360 gallons per minute per jets and one 3hp Buoyancy Pump. It's easy to set up and features a rapid heating system, which will heat the water to a toasty 40-degrees centigrade (or less, if you desire).</p>

<p>It is said that hot tubs helps people by making the blood circulate better. Next to that there are headrests, water fountains, sound systems and thermal covers for a 360° wellness experience. Most swim spas sold in Canada will set you back between $10,000 and $50,000 CAD. Steamy hot tubs can also pose a risk of Legionnaires' disease , a type of pneumonia caused by Legionella bacteria. Wooden hot tubs are still used in some spas and resorts, for the special touch they enhance the interior design with a certain "je ne sai quois" reminding us of long-forgotten times when there were no modern bathrooms and people had to bath in wooden tubs.</p>

<p>It's also possible that you might be wanting to build a permanent hydrotherapy pool maybe as an addition to your own pool in your garden in which case this would be referred to as a spa. Swim spas usually only have seating at one end with 2 or 4 powerful swim jets at the other. If you're thinking about investing in a swim spa, you're probably interested in its health and exercise benefits. The water is hot and the jets are powerful which I find amazing for a 110 V appliance.</p>
<p>A massage, body treatment, or esthetics treatment is the perfect addition to your time in our world famous natural hot mineral water. Hot Tub manufactures have improved the jets to give a better hydrotherapeutic effect. All swim spas, hot tubs , and Jacuzzis contain jets to mix air with pressurized water to provide a massage experience. Perspiration caused due to a sauna bath helps in opening up skin pores and expulsion of body toxins and impurities.</p>
<p>Experience the heated-water hydrotherapy and jetted hydromassage benefits of a hot tub, with the increased hydrostatic-pressure benefits of a swim spa. Sure, the waters were colder than I usually like, and my body had to endure a bit of punishment it's not accustomed to (plus, there's shrinkage), but the thrill generated by the competition convinced me that adding open water swims to my racing repertoire is a definite must.</p>
