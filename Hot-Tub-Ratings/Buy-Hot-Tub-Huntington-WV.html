<p>When you install your hot tub on the deck and start to enjoy it, it is then you realize that you need to have a gazebo or an enclosure to give you privacy from prying eye when you are inside. Note: Our swim spas are fully plumbed and mechanically assembled, ready for use other than a couple of final connections at the site. But one exercise that never goes out of style is swimming. Swimming is exercise, and with any exercise we are losing moisture from the body - and it is important to replenish this moisture. Clearwater Spas warrants the operating equipment and plumbing against defects in workmanship for five years from the original purchase date.</p>
<p>Look for swim spas that are insulated to keep in the heat and pumps and motors that are rated more energy efficient. When you get the hot tubs, the first thing you need to do it to read the installation manual very carefully. Obviously spa pools are wet areas. The self-cleaning swim spas clean 100% of the water in the unit in just 45 minutes, so you can spend more time enjoying your swim spa.
