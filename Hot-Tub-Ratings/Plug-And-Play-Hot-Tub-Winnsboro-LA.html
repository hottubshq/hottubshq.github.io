<p>I have been asked this question by so many customers. Embrace the ultimate aquatic workout experience with a Swim Pro Swim & Fitness Spa. You can find more in-depth information on the benefits of whirlpool baths and discover whether a whirlpool bath is the right choice for you. As the Jacuzzi brand became more famous, people started referring to a hot tub as a jacuzzi. I would not buy a Jacuzzi Hot Tub if the majority of the jets were unadjustable for one thing they can be painful.</p>
<p>Additionally, these swim spas are extremely relaxing and induce hydrotherapy with massaging jets and contour seating. If you want to heat your swim spa at all you need to consider buying a dual zone swim spa so you can use the electric heater(s) to affordably heat just the spa end only and take the edge off” the temperature in the swim end. This is due to the types of pumps, swim jets and plumbing used by many brands and the fact that they do not understand the technology involved.</p>
<p>However it is also not advisable to spend most of your time swimming. Jacuzzi spas are warranted against water loss due to defects in the spa shell for ten years. Once you've decided on your perfect spa, check out our assortment of accessories for JACUZZI® Hot Tubs to complement your outdoor spa setup.
