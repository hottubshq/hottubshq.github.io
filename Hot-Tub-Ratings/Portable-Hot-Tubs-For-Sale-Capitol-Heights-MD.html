<p>If you want a bathtub that can double as a place to wash your body, as well as soak and relax, you will want to consider jetted bathtubs, or the more common name, whirlpool tub. But spa” is also used as the American term for a hot tub equipped with strong jets that mix air into the water for a more pronounced massage effect.
