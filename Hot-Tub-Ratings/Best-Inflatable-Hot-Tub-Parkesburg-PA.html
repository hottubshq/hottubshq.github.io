Our most compact swim spa, the X200 combines our new jetted swim current with the mental and physical health benefits of hydromassage. Due to the wiring of many spas not being capable of supporting a large pump as well as the heater at the same time, a ‘load shed' setting is adopted or the heater is simply turns off completely while the spa is in use.</p>

The calcium can also build up on the sensors of the Hot Tub that regulate and deal with temperature and water flow, which can cause problems later.

<p>Initially, they took to soaking in hot water filled wine barrels and other large wooden vessels and they, logically enough, called these hot tubs. When you use a sauna, jacuzzi, hot tub or steam room, your body is unable to lose heat effectively by sweating. The acidic quality of vinegar eats away at oily residue that has built up in the tub as well as the calcium and other chemical deposits in the jets and tubing.</p>
<p>It is important to note, though, that the overall size of a swim spa is different from the amount of usable swimming space it contains. Most swim spas found in Canada fall into the mid-range category; costing between $20,000-$35,000. Your swim spa will be the perfect outlet for relaxation, leisure, fun with family. The temperature in an unheated walk-in tub drops to 98.6 in 10 minutes, requiring the bather to add more hot water to remain comfortable.</p>

Aquatic exercise in an exercise pool gives all the benefits of land-based aerobic workouts, but keeps your body cool and comfortable and no impact injury potential.

<p>Hot Tubs Rock are a small team, capable of delivering the personal touch on every hire. Backyard Oasis offers two incredible hot tub brand options: Hot Spring and Freeflow Spas. You should also consider a location that will minimize the mess of water, because an indoor hot tub makes it easier to get out of the tub and walk through the rest of the house before drying off. You can customize most swim spas with steps, an ozone or bromine filtration system, cover or various colors of internal shells and external cabinet.</p>
<p>While budget swim spas promise a lesser financial burden initially, much more can go wrong if inferior materials and unskilled labor are used. In fact, some swim spas offer more versatility than large pools. In almost all cases the pumps and pipework are all contained under the bath so space shouldn't be a problem unless you're looking for a larger bath.
