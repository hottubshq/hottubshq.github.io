<p>When people refer to a hot tub or a spa, they often think of the word Jacuzzi. When you exercise in one of these spas, you will be utilizing every muscle group in your body in a controlled setting. Given that the skill level to install a Jacuzzi bathtub is fairly high, most homeowners hire a pro. It produces a certain water current that allows you to swim there for as long as you want without hitting any walls. We had a jacuzzi tub in our old home and the jets never seemed clean no matter what I tried.</p>
<p>Always keep an eye on your child while they are near water, even if they aren't swimming. We Know Hot Tubs. You can have self-contained and "portable" unit, you can just get a Swim Spa shell and set it into a deck, you can have a customized Swim spa made for you or you can get a Swim Spa Water Jet and install it into your existing above ground or inground swimming pool. This is obviously very important for your hot tub's long-term efficiency and the water's cleanliness.</p>
<p>Change body positions to target different muscle groups for horizontal swimming, upright aerobic fitness and seated strength conditioning. Jacuzzi manufacturers their tubs in Valdosta, Georgia so you know your tub will meet U.S. standards and license requirements.

Now the price of a Swim Spa seems very reasonable when compared to a $16,000 hot tub or a $40,000 inground pool. For all swim spas, be sure to maintain a chlorine level of about 1.0 - 2.0 ppm or if using bromine, 2.0 - 4.0 ppm.
