<p>If you are unfamiliar with a swim spa, then just the title is enough to make you wonder what it is and how it can benefit you. First this is something that can help you solve a lot of the problems of the day as you take the time to relax in your hot tub at home after a long days drive, or a long day at the office. The portion in which you can swim laps are what makes a swim spa uniquely different from a hot tub alone.

<p>If your hot tub is freestanding, you will need to provide steps so that people can climb into the tub and step onto the seating area. While there are many similarities between an exercise spa, lap pool and swim spa, securing a great deal comes from understanding exactly what you are looking for and why.
