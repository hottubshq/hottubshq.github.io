If your hot tub is freestanding, you will need to provide steps so that people can climb into the tub and step onto the seating area.

Similar to a regular bathtub you would see in a home, these hot tubs, sometimes called whirlpool baths or Jacuzzis, are filled with water for each use than drained when your soaking is complete.</p>
