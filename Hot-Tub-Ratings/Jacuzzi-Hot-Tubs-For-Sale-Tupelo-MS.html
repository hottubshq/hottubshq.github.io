<p>A guy named Dr. Stephen Blair (University of South Carolina) conducted an extended survey to study the effectiveness of swimming for fitness. 3. Programmable circulation pumps-This system is larger and has the option to be time programmed on how long you want it to run for, dependable on how often your spa is being used meaning they are energy efficient.
