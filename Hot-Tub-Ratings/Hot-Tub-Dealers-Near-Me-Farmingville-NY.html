<p>Many people dream of installing a swimming pool in their backyards. Browse through the catalogs to find premium quality corner bathtubs, couple bathtubs, oval bathtubs, round series bathtubs, jacuzzis bathtubs, etc. Pay a little more and you'll get a better swimming experience, better components and lower running costs. You would usually work your entire backyard around a dedicated swimming pool area, but a swim spa will fit into a much smaller backyard or outdoor alfresco area.</p>
<p>The most prominent safety feature walk-in tubs bring to the table — the door — also has a downside because you can't fill the tub with water before entering it, which could leave you a bit chilled. Hot tubs offer rest and relaxation. Swim spas are perfect for anyone who is looking for a healthy, low-impact way to exercise on a daily basis. And just like its namesake, great performance is exactly what you'll experience with the Michael Phelps Legend Series hot tub.</p>
<p>The Vortex control system will adapt and tune itself to the thermal properties of your spa pool and its environment, day to day, season to season, this will reduce 'on-demand heating'. As a fun way to unwind and relieve stress, hot tubs and home spas allow family members to have fun conversation while relaxing together.
