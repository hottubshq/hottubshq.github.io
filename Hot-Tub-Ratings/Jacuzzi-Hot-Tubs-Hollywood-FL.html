<p>That wonderful feeling you get whenever you sit back in a hot tub is because of the way your body reacts to the heat and jets of water. High-end swim spas are also generally larger than mid-range swim spas and include added hydrotherapy and fitness options that aren't found in other swim spas. The Jacuzzi Fast Drain technology drains the water in half the time it takes a standard tub to empty, which is a plus for your comfort while you wait to be able open the door. Come see our large selection of pre-owned hot tubs. Just think of it. Your whole body soaked in hot water, your back and legs and arms being gently massaged by sensual jets of water, with soothing bubbles all around, and feelings of peace and tranquility taking over your body as you close your eyes and start to dream and look back at the kind of day it's been.</p>
<p>Swimlife is in the swimspa business for life and the only way to ensure success is to produce, offer and innovate the highest quality swimspas possible. Also, swim spas require a metal frame for support (which does not like being underground) and have the equipment (which requires access) inside the cabinet. Above ground hot tubs are freestanding basins that can be positioned anywhere, provided that there is connection to electric energy.</p>
<p>Jets are located around the sides of the tub and air injectors are located under the seats. For example, it's easy to see you need to buy a Synergy or a TruSwim swim spa if you want cascading water spouts, not a Vitality model. It lets you swim, exercise, play, and entertain; it's the perfect fun-and-fitness solution for family, friends, and solo retreats. Built tough for the great Aussie outdoors, your spa pool or swim spa will last, backed by our lifetime care commitment.</p>

Just about anything you can think of in these type tubs can be installed and operating in a matter of no more than a couple hours time.</p>
<p>Depending on the model that you choose you can have up to 3 River Jets powered by a total of 12 HP (18 BHP) on our Performance Plus Swim Spa Package. The Endless Pools® hydraulically powered underwater treadmill offers low-impact run or walk options. Swim spas are designed for exercise.

<p>For this reason, it is now mandatory on public swimming pools in many states in the US. However, a swim spa can be a great addition to your backyard, as it offers the dual benefits of swimming and the spa experience on your own property. If your swim spa is not insulated or if you have lower-powered pumps, you might end up wasting money on high water and electric bills. The average swim spa weighs 3,000 pounds before adding a drop of water, and measures roughly 52 inches high.</p>

Jacuzzi still to this day continues to innovate & lead the hot tub industry forward. One of the most overlooked areas in a swimspa is the ability of the unit to provide benefits outside the swim and massage.</p>
<p>The innovative bowed sidelines of the Kona , Sport and Splash Series are more comfortable than conventional swim spas, creating a more spacious swim area with greater freedom of movement. An Endless Pools® Fitness System and Swim Spa from the makers of Hot Spring® Spas, truly is a versatile option for the backyard.

<p>The Jacuzzi can be enjoyed at any time of the year, that is for a full 365 days, perhaps to cool off on a warm sultry day or to warm up on a winters evening. Our offered Jacuzzi Massage Bath Tubis an integral part of places such as spas and other wellness centers. Because we take pride in our products, Royal Spa swim spas have a lower cost of ownership than our competitors, though our sticker price will not be lowest you can find.</p>

Arctic Spas® has solutions for these valid concerns with our FreeHeat and Spa Boy® technology greatly lowering your monthly energy costs and to help maintain ideal spa conditions.</p>
