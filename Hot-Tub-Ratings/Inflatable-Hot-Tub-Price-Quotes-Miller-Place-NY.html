<p>Hydrotherapy and Jacuzzi hot tubs seem to go hand and hand these days. The comfort features in a Jacuzzi walk-in tub enhance the benefits of passive heating. This is absolutely vital if the shell of the swim spa is to last the lifetime of ownership. We are offering Claw Foot Bath Tubto our client and our product is made of good quality. Coast Spas® has partnered with Owens Corning® to Deliver the Toughest and Most Durable Hot Tub Shells Available. Many manufacturers design modern hut tubs and whirlpools to fit in most of the narrow bathrooms that still use small old tubs.</p>
<p>With the burgeoning interest in health and leisure across the United States, yet another opportunity was spotted in the 1960s, by Roy Jacuzzi, who invented and marketed the first self-contained, fully-integrated whirlpool bath, creating a whole new industry almost on his own. In short, hot tubs and Jacuzzis are not the same. Tests have proven that through having a heat pump within your spa pool or swim spa, running costs are reduced by over 50%, resulting in shortened and achievable payback period.</p>
<p>If you are planning to heat your swim spa for some or all of the year the best way to do this is with a heat pump which can heat (and potentially cool) your spa - providing total control over the water temperature for under $10 a week. It's important to note that some insurance providers simply won't cover you with the additional risk that a hot tub introduces. We recommend that you consult a plumber to calculate precisely what size water heater you'll need for a walk-in tub so you won't shortchange the rest of your household while bathing.</p>
