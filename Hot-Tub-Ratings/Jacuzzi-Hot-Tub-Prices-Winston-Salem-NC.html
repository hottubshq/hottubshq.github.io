<p>Riptide swim spas and exercise pools delivered and installed by our experienced team. Hot water is a great way to keep the body moving. A Jacuzzi soaking tub is the most common type of tub, and this basic concept is Jacuzzi's foundation for hydrotherapy tubs. Some hot tubs also come with features that Jacuzzi products do not, such as flat-screen TVs and built-in MP3 audio systems. Our Swim Spa River Jets are each powered solely by a 4 HP (6BHP) Hyper Flow Jet Pump. Having the swim spa completely above ground is another option that allows you to fence only the steps (as long as the swim spa is over 1200mm high the height of pool fencing).</p>
<p>A good way to locate leaks in your hot tub is by using food coloring and by adding it to the water. Swim Spas are the professional athlete's choice when selecting a swimming pool, and can form an important part of the day-to-day fitness regime of anyone who wants to stay in good shape. Chemicals used to clean and disinfect hot tubs may cause allergic reactions in some people. With three airless swim jets, seating for the family, spa seats with 27 hydromassage jets and plenty of room to move, the R120 sets a new benchmark for quality and value.</p>
<p>It has 20 powerful stainless steel jets, contoured seating for up to five people (although five is a more reasonable max), has a heat pump that plugs into a normal outlet, and holds 241 gallons of water. So as to become a preferential business name, we are thoroughly engrossed in shipping an inclusive collection of Whirlpool Jacuzzi Spa. Some also offer dual-temperature control where you can set one side of the swim spa to a comfortable swimming temperature and the other side to a temperature more suited to hydrotherapy.</p>

Keep in mind both swim spas and spas are optimised for different water types, depending on your preference. The trees and fence that you see at the west end start shading the spa from 1.30pm onwards at the spa seat end of the pool which has made it very comfortable during hot summer days.</p>
<p>With some minor reconstruction of the bathroom design, even older homes can take advantage of this concept bathtub to open up the room and give a more meditative soak. Infrared home saunas, however, create a sauna environment within a wooden box or even an open space while the heaters create the actual heating effect.
