Hot tubs installation day is exciting & with a little planing hot tub installation will go smoothly, you can start enjoying or hot tub right away. Whether you choose an inground or above ground swim spa, the safety regulations are the same as they would be for a full-sized swimming pool. We offer only hot tubs made from western red cedar (Thuja Plicata). Testing a water sample weekly and adding the right chemicals to get the correct levels is essential to maintaining your swim spa.</p>
<p>It is recommended that a whirlpool bathtub be cleaned at least twice a month. Swim Spas also act as smaller swimming pools in the sense that you can play around in them, or with some of the split-models, you actually have a hot tub spa in one end of it and a swimming area in the other end. Regularly have a professional check your spa or hot tub and make sure it is in good, safe working condition, and that drain covers are in place and not cracked or missing.</p>
<p>The 8' x 12' (94'' x 144'') Master Spas® swim spa replacement cover is a Master Spa Factory OEM replacement part (SKU: X454128). This Jacuzzi bathtub is the easiest way of bringing lavishness and grace with elegance to your lifestyle. This is a self-contained Swim Spa that has been set on the ground and then had a wood deck built around it. Notice that the body of water is all together (not separated into two areas).</p>

Don't forget that if you're pregnant or have heart disease you'll need to avoid using hot tubs and spa baths. Let's face it - hot tubs are hot. One does not use the Finnish sauna for long periods at a time (ideally, not more than two sessions in a day), and exits the sauna room to rinse the body in cold water between sessions.</p>

<p>I have quickly become addicted to a rigorous program of aquatic exercise and swimming. If your child is in the pool or hot tub, especially if they are very young, get into the water with them.
