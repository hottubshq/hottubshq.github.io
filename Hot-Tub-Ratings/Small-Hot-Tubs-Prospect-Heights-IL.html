The insulation around the cabinet traps in waste heat created by the pumps and heater, greatly increasing the energy efficiency of the swim spa as a whole.</p>
<p>In 1970, Jacuzzi added heating and filtration systems to its tubs in order to keep them clean and warm.

<p>The new Coleman SaluSpa Inflatable AirJet Hot Tub bucks the trend of circular hot tubs in favor of a more square-shaped design, but it's able to provide 114 air jets to pamper you in relaxing heated water, up the the 104 degree maximum temperature. Our SwimCross Exercise System combines a five-speed jetted resistance current with smart features to deliver a complete fitness program for all ages. Neck and back pain, sports injuries, muscle pulls, spasms and soreness are often eased simply by a quick dip in your hot tub.</p>
<p>Besides scrubbing down your Jacuzzi every so often, you must make sure all water is removed from the jetted tub after each use. In this way the water is directed to all the parts of the body and provides the massage. Today spas are frequently attached to hotels and sports complexes and come in a variety of different sizes and configurations. Draining & refilling of your spa or hot tub on a regular basis is the simplest, single best thing you can do to control odors.</p>
<p>In a Whirlpool bath you can direct the jets to specific muscles in your leg or back or wherever you're feeling tight. From our design engineers in California to our tradespeople in Georgia, we take pride in carrying on the Jacuzzi® legacy of quality.
