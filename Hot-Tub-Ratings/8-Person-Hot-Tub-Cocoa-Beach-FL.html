<p>Hot tub pumps keep the massage jets powered and also help keep the water clean by circulating the water. A big expensive of a hot tub is the time and cost of manufacturing the actual hot tub shell, many of these are make from acrylic and fibre glass, but there are now a new and much cheaper way of manufacturing a hot tub shell by using rotational moulding, this is a much quicker process and therefore being down the manufacturing costs of hot tubs, therefore manufactures can sell cheap hot tubs Even thought these hot tub are cheap they still using the same quality parts as the expensive manufactures put in there hot tubs.</p>
