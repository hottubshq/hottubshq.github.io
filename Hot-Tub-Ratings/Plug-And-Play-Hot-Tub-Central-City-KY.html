Another primary reason many homeowners are now opting for indoor hot tubs rather than outside is the weather. These X-Series models stand out from typical jetted options because the four swim jets are air-free and produce a no-turbulence current. Quality spa heaters are always placed within a marine grade stainless steel tube.</p>
<p>This is also how hot tubs take away stress. Hot tubs are unlike saunas, steam- and Turkish baths, which are steam only. You can easily assemble a swim spa together and use it as a portable swimming pool, wherever you go. Positioned to hit your shoulders and torso (jets that are too far apart or too low will not create the required resistance against the body and are a waste of water flow). Spas should also have a diverter valve to maintain water pressure on 1 or 2 seats.</p>
