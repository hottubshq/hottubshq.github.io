<p>Did you know that a swimming pool is not only fun to swim and relax in? Aside from the consideration of a spa's heat pump, the insulation within a spa pool determines how much output energy is required to maintain it. There are three main insulation systems used today, it is dependable on the company, manufacturer and model as to which one is adopted. The TruSwim® unique dual propulsion design guarantees an incomparable aquatic fitness experience with endless possibilities. We have been researching, ranking and reviewing swim spas for more than four years.</p>

It's important to note that some insurance providers simply won't cover you with the additional risk that a hot tub introduces. We recommend that you consult a plumber to calculate precisely what size water heater you'll need for a walk-in tub so you won't shortchange the rest of your household while bathing.</p>
