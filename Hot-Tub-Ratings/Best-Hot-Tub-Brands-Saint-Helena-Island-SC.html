<p>Hooking up your new hot tub will require you to understand a few electrical jargons. Only the Swim Spa WaterWatch® tracks distance and monitors performance, heart rate, calories and more while offering real time results and feedback. With a Coast Spas Wellness Spa® you'll sleep and feel better, increase your fitness and stamina, elevate your mood as well as lower your blood pressure. From time to time it may become necessary to update or change our Privacy Statement and ThermoSpas encourages you to periodically check here for the most current version.</p>
<p>It is recommended that a whirlpool bathtub be cleaned at least twice a month. Swim Spas also act as smaller swimming pools in the sense that you can play around in them, or with some of the split-models, you actually have a hot tub spa in one end of it and a swimming area in the other end. Regularly have a professional check your spa or hot tub and make sure it is in good, safe working condition, and that drain covers are in place and not cracked or missing.</p>
<p>A pool spa is used for people who have plenty of room in their yard and who want the best of both worlds for their swimming and relaxation pleasure. If you don't have kids or plan to only use your spa for swimming and exercise, a one tank spa might work out better. All Vortex Swim Spas are big enough for inflatable toys right up to a floating lounger. This company has five lines of swim spas: AquaPlay, AquaTrainer, ExecutiveTrainer, AquaSport and ExecutiveSport.</p>

<p>Compared to a pool, the ratio of people to volume of water is drastically different to in a spa, prompting unexpected spikes in pH. A jump in pH can cause the water to become alkaline and cloudy, leading to scale build up in your spa. In addition, swimming can be great for runners recovering from injuries since it not only helps maintain good physical health but also improves mental health. The insulation around the cabinet traps in waste heat created by the pumps and heater, greatly increasing the energy efficiency of the swim spa as a whole.</p>

<h3>What You Need To Know Before You Buy Saint Helena Island</h3>

If you do have a water and electrical source outdoors, keep in mind that some hot tubs require an electrician to install whereas others are "plug and play" and can be set up much quicker.

<p>Additionally, these swim spas are extremely relaxing and induce hydrotherapy with massaging jets and contour seating. If you want to heat your swim spa at all you need to consider buying a dual zone swim spa so you can use the electric heater(s) to affordably heat just the spa end only and take the edge off” the temperature in the swim end. This is due to the types of pumps, swim jets and plumbing used by many brands and the fact that they do not understand the technology involved.</p>
