<p>Hot tub pumps keep the massage jets powered and also help keep the water clean by circulating the water. A big expensive of a hot tub is the time and cost of manufacturing the actual hot tub shell, many of these are make from acrylic and fibre glass, but there are now a new and much cheaper way of manufacturing a hot tub shell by using rotational moulding, this is a much quicker process and therefore being down the manufacturing costs of hot tubs, therefore manufactures can sell cheap hot tubs Even thought these hot tub are cheap they still using the same quality parts as the expensive manufactures put in there hot tubs.</p>
<p>The difference with swim spas is that they're often larger than a standard spa pool and have an open area at one end without seating. If an Extreme Lighting Package is installed on your spa, each corner will light up to match the color of light in your hot tub. When you allow the massaging jets to massage your sore spots or even just hold your feet up to the circulating massaging water you will immediately feel better and your feet won't hurt much at all.</p>
<p>So these many jets (not that many really) simply do not have enough power to actually make these Jets perform properly, So for performance in a Hot Tub it is just not a simple question of the number of Jets but it does come down to things like engineering and design and the balance of the Jets with the correct motors and water pumps to produce the better all round product More often than not, these Hot Tubs with lower rated motors have to have a diverter valve fitted so that other parts of the spa can be turned off to get any decent power where one is actually sitting.</p>
