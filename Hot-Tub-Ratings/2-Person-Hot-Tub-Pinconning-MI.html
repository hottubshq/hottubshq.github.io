However, when you use both a spa and a swimming pool, the possibilities and benefits are endless.</p>

These bacteria are found naturally in water, and hot tubs that aren't disinfected properly can become contaminated with Legionella, according to the CDC.</p>
<p>We consider the styles and sizes of swim spas each company makes as well as the number of spas available, the kinds of water jet propulsion systems used and price range. Our research shows PDC Spas is the best place to buy a swim spa because of its large selection, strong swim current systems, quick customer service and many fun options. Another important task is testing and adjusting the alkalinity of the water because if your water is hard, you'll end up having to replace swim spa parts.</p>
