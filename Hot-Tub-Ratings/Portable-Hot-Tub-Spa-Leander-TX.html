<p>Don't falsely assume that swim spas are only for the richer due to being costly. Deluxe 4-person hot tub with 40 hydrotherapy massage jets and a full body lounge. Jets - Some Hydro Massage Jets would be a very good idea to introduce the water into the Hot Tub and here I would suggest not those simple bullet hole type that are un adjustable and are merely copied from decades ago but those that are fully adjustable.

Obviously when outside the Hot tub will be more exposed to the elements and you will need to wear bath slippers or equivalent as you walk to the Jacuzzi to keep the water as clear as possible.</p>
