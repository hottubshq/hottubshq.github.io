<p>Many people dream of installing a swimming pool in their backyards. Browse through the catalogs to find premium quality corner bathtubs, couple bathtubs, oval bathtubs, round series bathtubs, jacuzzis bathtubs, etc. Pay a little more and you'll get a better swimming experience, better components and lower running costs. You would usually work your entire backyard around a dedicated swimming pool area, but a swim spa will fit into a much smaller backyard or outdoor alfresco area.</p>
<p>Outdoor hot tubs also come in a variety of styles but are generally either a round or octagon shape. Most of these accidents happened at a pool or hot tub at the child's own home. At almost six metres in length and two and a half metres in width, the AquaSport 19 DTfX acts as a swimming pool, hot tub and aquafit centre all in a single unit.

But hot tubs might not be safe for some people, including pregnant women and those with heart disease And when they aren't cleaned well, they pose risks to even healthy people.</p>

<p>Safe for the Whole Family - The swim spa is a great place to encourage family time. Jacuzzi features multiple different installation types for its tubs. Through it's sterilizing effect, Vortex's Purezone Spa Pool UV steriliser will not only make your spa safe for you and your family, but also reduce your use of chemical sanitisers. A proper swim spa where you swim against a current that is created by multiple pumps and special swim jets.</p>
<p>For this reason, it is now mandatory on public swimming pools in many states in the US. However, a swim spa can be a great addition to your backyard, as it offers the dual benefits of swimming and the spa experience on your own property. If your swim spa is not insulated or if you have lower-powered pumps, you might end up wasting money on high water and electric bills. The average swim spa weighs 3,000 pounds before adding a drop of water, and measures roughly 52 inches high.</p>
<p>It has separate temperature controls for the swimming lane and hot tub which means that someone can be comfortably practicing their stroke at a swimming pool temperature while others can be seated in warmer waters in the hot tub area. Unlike pools, you can change the current intensity to suit any swimming level you desire. Hot tub accidents or injuries for home residents are not covered; that falls under your health insurance plan.</p>
