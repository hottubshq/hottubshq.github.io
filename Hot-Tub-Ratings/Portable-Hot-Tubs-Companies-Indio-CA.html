<p>Not everyone can afford to pay $5,000 (or more) for a hot tub. The water in NSPs is 100 percent free from chemicals making it very desirable for swimming. Endless Pools has only a few accessories for sale, although it does sell underwater exercise equipment.

For example, a recent survey of Catalina swim spa reviews led me to discover that Catalina had just ended such a sale as I begin to write this piece, while investigating Michael Phelps swim spa options didn't turn up much of anything where special pricing was concerned. He designed a portable pump that could be fitted inside a bathtub to give the hydro-therapy.</p>
<h3>Hot Tub New Indio CA 92201</h3>
