<p>While it is rather unfortunate, from time to time your hot tub may have a leak in it. Thankfully, there are some easy methods that you can implement that allow you to locate the leak and have it fixed. If you've yet to explore the incredible benefits of swim spas, here's your chance.

<p>With the burgeoning interest in health and leisure across the United States, yet another opportunity was spotted in the 1960s, by Roy Jacuzzi, who invented and marketed the first self-contained, fully-integrated whirlpool bath, creating a whole new industry almost on his own. In short, hot tubs and Jacuzzis are not the same.

Owning a Jacuzzi® Hot Tub allows you to take advantage of a water-based therapeutic technique known as hydrotherapy. These lightweight and robustly constructed tubs are provided with air switch, hand shower, golf waterfall and dream pillow.</p>
