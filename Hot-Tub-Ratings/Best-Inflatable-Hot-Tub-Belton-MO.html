<p>When you have made the decision to buy a Hot Tub then you have to consider carefully where you will locate the Jacuzzi Hot Tub. Their filtration systems are also made for hot tubs and are not designed to efficiently clean the amount of water found in a swim spa. Swim Spas provide the absolute best swimming exercise work out, using the least amount of space in your home or yard. By incorporating body jets into the sides of the tub, it became the bath that almost single-handedly created an industry.

<h3>Jacuzzi Hot Tub Specification Guides And Model Information Belton</h3>
<p>Every Jacuzzi® hot tub has been researched and engineered to deliver advanced hydrotherapy and with patented jet technology a truly unique hot tub experience. All models have exactly the same seating layout and features, the only difference is the number of swim jets in the swim resistance zone and the overall number of pumps.

<p>Hot water is a great way to keep the body moving. A Jacuzzi soaking tub is the most common type of tub, and this basic concept is Jacuzzi's foundation for hydrotherapy tubs. Some hot tubs also come with features that Jacuzzi products do not, such as flat-screen TVs and built-in MP3 audio systems. Our Swim Spa River Jets are each powered solely by a 4 HP (6BHP) Hyper Flow Jet Pump. Having the swim spa completely above ground is another option that allows you to fence only the steps (as long as the swim spa is over 1200mm high the height of pool fencing).</p>
<p>Design in hot tubs has no limits. Homeowners can also hire professionals to clean the Jacuzzi bathtubs for them. This type of hot tub is located in the privacy of your home so it is only viewable to people you are already comfortable with. Jacuzzi Pure Air tubs offer the unique experience of a steady stream of bubbles that soothe the body. Hot tubs have no such current, but the water often swirls and bubbles around sitters as they relax.</p>
