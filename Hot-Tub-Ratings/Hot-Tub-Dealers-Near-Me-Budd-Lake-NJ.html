Chlorine and bromine are both excellent sanitizers used in spas and hot tubs. Indoor hot tubs eliminate the awkwardness of using the tub in front of neighbors or passersby.

Hydrotherapy in a hot tub provides relief for high blood pressure because it dilates or opens up blood vessels so the heart doesn't have to pump as hard.
