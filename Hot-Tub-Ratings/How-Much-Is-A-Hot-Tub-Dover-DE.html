<p>Spas and Hot tubs have enjoyed huge popularity of the last few years. This is a spa that is offered at a fitness club or a recreational club as an added facility. Unlike a swimming pool which can be quite costly to install and requires a large backyard, swim spas offer this all-in-one portable package in a box that can be craned into position in an hour. If you plan to heat your swim spa regularly, especially the swim end due to the large amount of water, you need to be able to use a gas or a heat pump as the electric heaters will be very expensive.</p>
<p>Our new jetted swim current lets you exercise with gentle resistance, and then unwind in ergonomically sculpted hydromassage seats. The photo to the left shows the hot tub spa area of an all-in-one Swim Spa unit. You don't need to have the jets or blowers on - there is nothing like laying in your own hot tub, with just your head poking out of the water, watching the sun go down. With a swim spa at home, the incredible benefits of aquatic fitness are delivered right to your doorstep—no traveling, monthly gym membership or navigating a crowded pool filled with strangers.</p>
<p>The Antigua spa, with a diameter of 2.78 metres, has a groundbreaking octagonal design that adds that extra touch of luxury and distinction, which is so prized in hotels, residential complexes, beauty centres, spas, etc. No matter how you design you Jacuzzi Hot Tub, you are sure the durable finishes will last you many years to come.
