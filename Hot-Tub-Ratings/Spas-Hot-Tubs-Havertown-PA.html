<p>As inviting and innocuous-looking as your Jacuzzi or hot tub may seem, using it for therapeutic purposes will require more precaution than you probably expect. Your hot tub will have jets and blowers, which can be switch on or off, depending on how you feel. Just like our large range of spas , our selection of swim spa options spans all budgets and specifications. In the 1940s hot tubs began to appear in the USA, inspired by the Japanese ofuro Hydrotherapy pumps were introduced by Jacuzzi Fiberglass shell hot tubs appeared around 1970 and were soon superseded by cast acrylic shells.</p>
<p>This is also how hot tubs take away stress. Hot tubs are unlike saunas, steam- and Turkish baths, which are steam only. You can easily assemble a swim spa together and use it as a portable swimming pool, wherever you go. Positioned to hit your shoulders and torso (jets that are too far apart or too low will not create the required resistance against the body and are a waste of water flow). Spas should also have a diverter valve to maintain water pressure on 1 or 2 seats.</p>
<p>Experience the heated-water hydrotherapy and jetted hydromassage benefits of a hot tub, with the increased hydrostatic-pressure benefits of a swim spa. Sure, the waters were colder than I usually like, and my body had to endure a bit of punishment it's not accustomed to (plus, there's shrinkage), but the thrill generated by the competition convinced me that adding open water swims to my racing repertoire is a definite must.</p>

<p>This can range from large, spa pools which you might find in a leisure centre or health club, to private whirlpool baths for domestic properties. Now the price of a Swim Spa seems very reasonable when compared to a $16,000 hot tub or a $40,000 inground pool. For all swim spas, be sure to maintain a chlorine level of about 1.0 - 2.0 ppm or if using bromine, 2.0 - 4.0 ppm. Meanwhile, the permanent hydrotherapy pools in the spas became known as spas or spa pools themselves just to make life a little more complicated.</p>
<p>For decades, the name Jacuzzi” has been synonymous with any contained body of water which includes water jets to aid relaxation. A Swim Spa is essentially an over-sized spa with an added current.
