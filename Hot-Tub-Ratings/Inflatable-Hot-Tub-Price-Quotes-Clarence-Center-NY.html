<p>When people refer to a hot tub or a spa, they often think of the word Jacuzzi. When you exercise in one of these spas, you will be utilizing every muscle group in your body in a controlled setting. Given that the skill level to install a Jacuzzi bathtub is fairly high, most homeowners hire a pro. It produces a certain water current that allows you to swim there for as long as you want without hitting any walls. We had a jacuzzi tub in our old home and the jets never seemed clean no matter what I tried.</p>

Some love the flexibility that a swim spa provides, while others are after the many features they offer. If you want to feel relaxed by pleasuring in the warm waters after an entire day of work, then you should install Jacuzzi in your bathroom to feel completely relaxed.</p>

<p>Instead of forking out more than $70k on a pool, many resorts to owning a spa swim that started with $14k. Swim spas can be used for many types of exercise, beyond the invigorating workouts you get swimming against the resistance current. In contrast to a typical bathtub , a hot tub is designed to be used by more than one person at a time, with many models accommodating four or more people. There are many companies that carry jetted tubs, some of the most well known include American Standard and Whirlpool bathtubs.</p>
<p>Sure, you eat right and exercise, but to really live well, you should add in a bit of hydrotherapy with a Healthy Living Hot Tub.

So if your swim spa's shell structure fails anytime within the 10 year warranty, we replace it. No questions asked.</p>
