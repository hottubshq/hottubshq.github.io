<p>Saunas have existed for thousands of years and are now being rediscovered the world over for their health and social benefits. First of all, Jacuzzi bathtubs are extremely expensive, costing anywhere from $600 to over $15,000 depending on the features they offer. All brands will have different features and components to make them different from other hot tub brands. Hot tubs can be installed in two different ways, either freestanding or inground. Our wider safety access steps and flat stepping areas at both the jet and seating end of the swimspas is functional and astietically pleasing.</p>
<p>Outdoor hot tubs also come in a variety of styles but are generally either a round or octagon shape. Most of these accidents happened at a pool or hot tub at the child's own home. At almost six metres in length and two and a half metres in width, the AquaSport 19 DTfX acts as a swimming pool, hot tub and aquafit centre all in a single unit. Unfortunately, there are a number of cons that come with having even a small Jacuzzi bathtub installed.</p>
<p>Just like hot tub spas, most Swim Spas are molded out of acrylic and are typically 12′ - 24′ in length. The unique shell design of the MP line of swim spas gives you a long and wide swim area with no hidden obstacles like benches or steps to hit your feet. Avoid hot tubs if you can during those 9 months. If you are looking for a free-standing pool with heated water, hydrotherapy jets, filtration system and one that is semi-permanent then a hot tub is what you need.</p>

Aquatic exercise in a swim spa can be helpful for people with chronic conditions, but Schulte said it varies by person.
