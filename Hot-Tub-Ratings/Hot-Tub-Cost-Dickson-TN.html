According to Wikipedia : a Hot Tub is a large tub or small pool full of heated water and used for hydrotherapy or pleasure. Add warmth and water movement and hot tubbing becomes the stuff of lifetime memories. If you do use a hot tub, turn down the temperature and limit your time in the water to less than 10 minutes. A Spa system will use air to push the water around your bath and create that bubble and whirl effects.</p>
