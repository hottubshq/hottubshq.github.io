<p>A guy named Dr. Stephen Blair (University of South Carolina) conducted an extended survey to study the effectiveness of swimming for fitness. All swim spa covers are made specifically to fit your Master Spas swim spa and come 6" thick in the middle and taper off to 4". This cover includes an energy efficient 1.5 lb foam density and a 24 R-value, with a full length heat seal and upgraded rubber grip handles (included!). We had limited space and the swim spa allowed us to maximise the use of our garden and has proven to be far more economical than a pool.</p>
<p>Fully adjustable current for swimming in place so you can focus on your form and never have to turn or push off a wall again. Late evenings or weekends may be times when the family can catch a few minutes together relaxing in the hot tub or spa.

Undoubtedly, the inclusion of a whirlpool tub in your bathroom is a huge selling point that can dramatically increase the return on your upgrade.</p>
