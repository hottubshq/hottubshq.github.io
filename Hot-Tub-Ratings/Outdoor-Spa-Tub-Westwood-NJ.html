<p>Hydrotherapy and Jacuzzi hot tubs seem to go hand and hand these days. The Endless Pools Fitness Systems shell has a modern style with clean lines that flow gracefully from end to end. Built from the highest quality acrylic, Endless Pools swim spas are designed to provide years of family fun and enjoyment. The Jacuzzi brother's patent ran out 10 years later in 1976 which lead to the American hot tub market taking off as they were able to use the Jacuzzi type jets. The original hydrotherapy jet was invented by the Jacuzzi® brothers in 1956.</p>
<p>2. 24 hour circulation pumps-These pumps function by using a small pump to force water through the heating and filtration system. The ingenuity behind the Endless Pools Swim Machine is just the beginning of the many benefits of owning an Endless Pools Fitness Systems. This is not the case if the spa has a Spa Net” brand controller (fully heat pump compatible). Most people are not duly trained in installing whirlpool tubs so it is strongly advised to hire a contractor for installation.</p>
<p>So these many jets (not that many really) simply do not have enough power to actually make these Jets perform properly, So for performance in a Hot Tub it is just not a simple question of the number of Jets but it does come down to things like engineering and design and the balance of the Jets with the correct motors and water pumps to produce the better all round product More often than not, these Hot Tubs with lower rated motors have to have a diverter valve fitted so that other parts of the spa can be turned off to get any decent power where one is actually sitting.</p>

<p>The idea is that you swim in the tub and the current produced by the swim spa pushes against you in much the same way as a treadmill.

However, they are designed to be smaller than regular pools, as their primary function is relaxation, although the swim jets do enable you to swim effectively within the space. Sure it looks like fun seeing all of the foam that can result from hot water, jets and bubble bath, but it's a sorry mess to clean up.
