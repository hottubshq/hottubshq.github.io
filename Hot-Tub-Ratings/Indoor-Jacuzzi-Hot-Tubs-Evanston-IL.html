It is advisable for people suffering from diarrhea, skin infections, intestinal infections or fresh wounds on any part of the body not to use the hot tubs.

There is a new invention called a Fast Lane Swim Jet unit that can be been retrofitted into most existing swimming pools.</p>
<p>In the sea most people spend some time splashing about to cool off as well as swimming, which also has benefits on your health. Compared to a swimming pool a swim spa requires much less space in your home or garden, yet despite the smaller footprint provides even the strongest swimmer a fantastic swimming experiences all year round.

<p>Indoor tubs may produce some moisture when in use, particularly if the ambient room temperature is much less than the water inside the vessel (hot tub water temperatures range from 100-104 degrees F).

The water inside a swim spa can provide a much more comfortable and enjoyable environment for low-impact exercise.</p>
