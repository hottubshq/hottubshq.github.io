<p>Spas and Hot tubs have enjoyed huge popularity of the last few years. This is a spa that is offered at a fitness club or a recreational club as an added facility. Unlike a swimming pool which can be quite costly to install and requires a large backyard, swim spas offer this all-in-one portable package in a box that can be craned into position in an hour. If you plan to heat your swim spa regularly, especially the swim end due to the large amount of water, you need to be able to use a gas or a heat pump as the electric heaters will be very expensive.</p>
<p>Don't forget to check out the plethora of hot tub accessories available on Wayfair that will only add to your hot tub experience. The faster the filters can clean the water , the less the swim spa will need to run when you're not using it. We liked the hard top cover and simplicity of the Eco Spas. Even though the current is strong, it will never come between you and your swim laps and workouts due to the consistency of the water flow that will never let you hit the end of the spa.</p>
