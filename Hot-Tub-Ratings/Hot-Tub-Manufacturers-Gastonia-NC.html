The circulation pump, jet pump(s) and electronic control system of all Vortex swim spas are warranted against defects for 2 years. Friends and family can enjoy a pleasant time soaking in the warm water and chatting. You do have to be cautious about the quality of used hot tubs.</p>
<p>The most difficult part about an inflatable hot tub is the inflation of it - and that's not too difficult or time consuming with an air pump.
