A proper swim spa where you swim against a current that is created by multiple pumps and special swim jets.</p>
<p>Swimming in a swim spa adds extra benefits. That is why if you notice, the jets are usually positioned at the most stressed muscles of the body - the calves, neck, some at the back, and at the sole of the feet. We favored those that sell spas with paddlewheel current systems, since they're usually the strongest. The bath water is recirculated through the jets, which keeps the water a bit warmer than air being forced in the bath.</p>
<p>The ancient Greeks and the Romans also all had a great love for communal hot baths fed by natural hot springs and many of these bath houses had massage facilities, sports arenas and places to eat included as well.
