<p>A dip in the warm water of a hot tub can help to soothe tight, sore muscles, and ending a date in the Jacuzzi might allow couples to relax and share intimate time in a whole new way. It has separate temperature controls for the swimming lane and hot tub which means that someone can be comfortably practicing their stroke at a swimming pool temperature while others can be seated in warmer waters in the hot tub area. Unlike pools, you can change the current intensity to suit any swimming level you desire.

<p>Jacuzzi bathtubs are considered a luxury and not something found in the average home. So, let's take a look at what's so great about these two hot tub brands. Just like hot tub spas, most Swim Spas are molded out of acrylic and are typically 12' - 24' in length. It is also worth inquiring on what type of insulation they have as some cheap hot tub will have none, and therefore cost more to run but some other cheap hot tubs are well insulated and will be cheaper to run.</p>
<p>With a variety of lengths, current styles and exercise features, your spa is customized to fit you and your home. Our Swim Spas offer the perfect choice for those who want the best of both: a luxury spa and fully-adjustable swim speed current, all-in-one. The Jacuzzi® brothers invented a pump and a small niche business was born.

In the late 1960s, Roy Jacuzzi, a third-generation Jacuzzi toyed with the idea of marketing the pump-fitted bath tub dubbed the 'Roman Bathtub' to cater for the growing need for leisure. When Swim Spas first came on the market about 10 years ago, they were priced in the $25,000 range. By having a smaller tub the volume of water is a lot less therefore running cost are reduced due to the heater having less water to heat.</p>
<p>A brand name for a device for a whirlpool bath and related products. If you do have a water and electrical source outdoors, keep in mind that some hot tubs require an electrician to install whereas others are "plug and play" and can be set up much quicker. We began as a small retail hot tub business, but due to the local industry's high demand for quality products and services, we found the need to expand within the first year.</p>
