<p>Swimming accessories are important for summer safety if you plan on swimming. With Jacuzzi for Life, you have the option of purchasing any 300, 400, 500 or LX series hot tub. Innovative jet pump & equipment technology and newer manufacturing methods made the cost of production of the Swim Spa to come down to the levels of a high quality portable hot tub.

<p>This is also how hot tubs take away stress. Hot tubs are unlike saunas, steam- and Turkish baths, which are steam only. You can easily assemble a swim spa together and use it as a portable swimming pool, wherever you go. Positioned to hit your shoulders and torso (jets that are too far apart or too low will not create the required resistance against the body and are a waste of water flow). Spas should also have a diverter valve to maintain water pressure on 1 or 2 seats.</p>
<p>Also, our Jacuzzi bathtub is designed using topmost grade material and progressive technology in conformity with latest market trends. Due to the hot, damp environment that occurs around a swim spa, even the hardiest of timbers will be susceptible to mold and mildew. You do not drain the water from a hot tub after each use. Jacuzzi tub brings the health benifits too. Swim spas provide space for kids to move around.
