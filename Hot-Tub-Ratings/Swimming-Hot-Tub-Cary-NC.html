<p>Interior design is about creating a harmonious space to live in, about creating exciting and functional environments in your home. Sure, if your bathroom is too small for a hot tub, or any tub for that matter, you could always choose a massage shower. Install fencing or invest in a sturdy cover that kids can't fall though, even if they step on it. Also, pull up or remove ladders from above-ground models when not in use to prevent children from climbing into the pool or hot tub.
