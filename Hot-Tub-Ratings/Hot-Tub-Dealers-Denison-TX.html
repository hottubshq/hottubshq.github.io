Swim Spas also act as smaller swimming pools in the sense that you can play around in them, or with some of the split-models, you actually have a hot tub spa in one end of it and a swimming area in the other end. Regularly have a professional check your spa or hot tub and make sure it is in good, safe working condition, and that drain covers are in place and not cracked or missing.</p>

PDC Spas has a big selection of swim spas with a variety of options for current power and jet customization. There are dangers to buying used spas, and if the hot tub is not set up and running so you can test the pump, heater, and other features, then you might be very disappointed when you get it home and set up.</p>
