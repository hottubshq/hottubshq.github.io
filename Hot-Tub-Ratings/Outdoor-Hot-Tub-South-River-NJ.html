<p>Family owned Sacramento dealer offering affordable high quality Turbo Spas and Swim Spas. You are probably thinking, Yeah, this sounds great, but it probably costs like a trillion dollars.” That is a common misconception about Swim Spas…that they are only for the fabulously wealthy. Illumatherapy also offers four points of entry, with two on each side of the tub, and air bubbles spraying from the jets give the appearance of dancing as they reflect the light. The blowers make the hot tub feel like you've got your own personal geyser - forcing air from the bottom of the pool, and creating a very relaxing environment for you.</p>
<p>If you want both hot and cold water in your spa then a dual zone swim spa is best. I use my hot tub almost every day, sometimes twice a day. Deluxe 6-person hot tub with 20 hydrotherapy massage jets and a full body lounge. Innovative features include ergonomic seating, hydrotherapy jets, and strong filtration. Jacuzzi AccuPro jets are the building blocks for Jacuzzi's Whirlpool tub, and send out a precise, pinpointed flow of water and air to target specific trouble spots on the user's body.</p>
<p>Change body positions to target different muscle groups for horizontal swimming, upright aerobic fitness and seated strength conditioning. Jacuzzi manufacturers their tubs in Valdosta, Georgia so you know your tub will meet U.S. standards and license requirements. So I say why stop at the swimming lessons, if people are coming to your swimming pool for rehabilitation and relaxation: supplement your swim pool environment with music.</p>

You can spend some time with your loved ones in this stress-free environment where you can relax together and catch up. Trying to swim spas with your close family members or friends could be fun and a new experience that will help you get closer to each other.</p>

In addition, the swimmer can adjust the direction of the water-flow for each river jet to ensure their swimming experience is perfect for their swimming style.</p>
