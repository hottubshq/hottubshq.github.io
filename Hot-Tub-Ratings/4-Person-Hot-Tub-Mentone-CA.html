<p>We all know that buying hot tubs isn't a joke.

There is no other name in aquatic fitness that is as recognized as Endless Pools. We offer financing options with approved credit for JACUZZI® Hot Tubs to ensure you find a spa within your price range. The therapeutic effects of water in hot tubs and the soothing feeling of sliding into a warm vortex of swirling hot spa waters can't be beat.</p>
<p>With the burgeoning interest in health and leisure across the United States, yet another opportunity was spotted in the 1960s, by Roy Jacuzzi, who invented and marketed the first self-contained, fully-integrated whirlpool bath, creating a whole new industry almost on his own. In short, hot tubs and Jacuzzis are not the same. Tests have proven that through having a heat pump within your spa pool or swim spa, running costs are reduced by over 50%, resulting in shortened and achievable payback period.</p>
<p>Jacuzzi® baths and showers are shipped from Georgia for delivery across North America. We also share your personal data with other companies within the ThermoSpas family for marketing and sales purposes. Once the art of staying afloat is mastered the swimmer can enjoy the feeling of being in the water, while the body's buoyancy means there is far less stress on the body that exercises such as running.
