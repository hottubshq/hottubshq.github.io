There is a swimming spa intended for toddlers or children. On a weekly basis, you should consider adding an anti-foaming agent to your hot tub's water. The benefits of hydrotherapy, whether in a swimming pool, or in a spa, are wide-spread.</p>
<p>It's an inflatable jacuzzi so you can still get a good deal on it, and it holds up to six people and more water than most: up to 290Gal (1097L).

<p>Other things to consider when thinking about adding a spa to your home are things like where is the water supply coming from, how heavy will it be and can it be supported, and also you need to take into consideration how many people may be using it. Now although you will probably have a fitter work everything out for you, make sure you question the plans as regards to any electrics and water supplies, so that you are clear in your own head that what they are suggesting can not only be implemented, but are also safe.</p>
