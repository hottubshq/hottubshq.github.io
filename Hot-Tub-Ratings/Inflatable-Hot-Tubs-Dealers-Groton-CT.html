The J-335IP, hot tub has an FX10 Therapy seat to fit every contour of the body and features 40 PowerPro® jets which deliver an effective hydromassage across the entire body with jets to target key areas including shoulders, wrists and feet. There is a swimming spa intended for toddlers or children. On a weekly basis, you should consider adding an anti-foaming agent to your hot tub's water. The benefits of hydrotherapy, whether in a swimming pool, or in a spa, are wide-spread.</p>
<p>It is recommended that a whirlpool bathtub be cleaned at least twice a month. Swim Spas also act as smaller swimming pools in the sense that you can play around in them, or with some of the split-models, you actually have a hot tub spa in one end of it and a swimming area in the other end. Regularly have a professional check your spa or hot tub and make sure it is in good, safe working condition, and that drain covers are in place and not cracked or missing.</p>
<p>There are many different benefits associated with using Jacuzzi hot tubs for hydrotherapy.

Whether you're interested in a form of socializing or a powerful way to rejuvenate and refresh your mind and body, Jacuzzi® hot tubs will leave you fully satisfied.</p>

Even if you don't have a regular recreational pool, make sure there isn't anything enticing left around your swim spa or hot tub.
