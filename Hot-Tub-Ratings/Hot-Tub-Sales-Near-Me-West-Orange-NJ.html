<p>If you are unfamiliar with a swim spa, then just the title is enough to make you wonder what it is and how it can benefit you.

Get an ergonomic experience in the kitchen with a Jacuzzi® farmhouse apron sink Bring a little decadence home from Lowe's today. Our Wellness Spas® feature the ability not only to swim in place endlessly against a powerful counter-current, but also to strength-train and even experience a therapeutic hydrotherapy massage.</p>
<p>Hot tubs are becoming very popular due to their many benefits. Don't jump straight from the hot tub into the pool to cool off. The tub will have a wooden seat or bench running around the walls, so that it's easy for people to sit down and relax. Hydrotherapy is a treatment you can avail of in a hot tub for relaxation with the combination of heat, massage and buoyancy. For that reason, most people have no idea what a swim spa really costs.</p>
<p>Swim spas can often be used like regular hot tubs. The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG) states that becoming overheated in a hot tub is not recommended during pregnancy. If a swim spa isn't quite what you're looking for, there are a wide range of alternatives to swim spas in Australia. When it comes to setting standards for swim spa covers, the Smartop Vanish Swim Spa Cover (XTST113) sets the bar high.</p>

<p>You can add a Fast Lane Swim Jet unit to most inground or above ground pools and instantly have a Swim Spa water current in your existing pool. Induce yourself in the wellness of hydro massage, Chromo therapy, and air massage offered by Oyster bath, the leading spa bathtub manufacturers. In 1968, Roy Jacuzzi invented the first format of a self-contained, fully integrated whirlpool bath that attracted number of people to luxuriate in its relaxing spray of waters.</p>
<p>Now, this was fine for a number of years until, of course, spas started springing up in hotels and sports complexes and going to the spa” (yah!) just like the Romans did became cool again. Go for a more powerful spa pump if you have a bigger jacuzzi or the pressure of water in your area is relatively lower. After hitting the slopes in Irownwood, use your hot tub to aid in repairing sore muscles and injuries. Hotel Spas - These are the same as the above the only difference would be it may come in with your all inclusive package where you would get unlimited treatment, drinks and food.</p>

Most spas will have a suite of rooms with varying experiences in each.

<p>Today Jacuzzis are normally found in residential homes, hotels suites, aboard cruise ships, and in the spas sprinkled in all parts of the world. The intensity and direction of the hydromassages, the water temperature regulation and the jets number are managed through a digital control board for the hydrotherapy to be efficient. You want the very latest in design whereby the Jets provide a vigorous massage to loosen those tight knotted muscles and at the same time increase the blood and oxygen circulation which helps to bring nutrients to sore muscles and joints.</p>
<p>Experience the heated-water hydrotherapy and jetted hydromassage benefits of a hot tub, with the increased hydrostatic-pressure benefits of a swim spa. Sure, the waters were colder than I usually like, and my body had to endure a bit of punishment it's not accustomed to (plus, there's shrinkage), but the thrill generated by the competition convinced me that adding open water swims to my racing repertoire is a definite must.</p>

This involves a considerable amount of extra work, however, as the ground in your backyard will have to be excavated before the installation can take place, just like it would with a regular inground swimming pool.</p>

Funny you should ask, because we happen to have a video that produced in 2008 at the Artesian Spas factory in Las Vegas, NV. The video is actually called "How Do They Build A Hot Tub Spa?", but the model that they are building in the video happens to be a large 16' Swim Spa.
