<p>A pool spa is used for people who have plenty of room in their yard and who want the best of both worlds for their swimming and relaxation pleasure.

All Vortex Swim Spas are big enough for inflatable toys right up to a floating lounger. This company has five lines of swim spas: AquaPlay, AquaTrainer, ExecutiveTrainer, AquaSport and ExecutiveSport.</p>
<p>Of course, we also looked at the swim spa systems each company offers. Spa (also hot tub): Unlike swim spas, these are made for relaxation.

Keep in mind both swim spas and spas are optimised for different water types, depending on your preference. The trees and fence that you see at the west end start shading the spa from 1.30pm onwards at the spa seat end of the pool which has made it very comfortable during hot summer days.</p>
