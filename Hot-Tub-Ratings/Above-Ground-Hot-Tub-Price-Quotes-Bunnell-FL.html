<p>Don't falsely assume that swim spas are only for the richer due to being costly. Each of the Jacuzzi® hot tubs in the J-300 collection comes with a ProClarity filtration system and a CLEARRAY® purification system. Hot Springs Resort and Spa has a licensed and professional Massage Therapists and Estheticians that provide a variety of relaxing and rejuvenating treatments.

The faster the filters can clean the water , the less the swim spa will need to run when you're not using it. We liked the hard top cover and simplicity of the Eco Spas. Even though the current is strong, it will never come between you and your swim laps and workouts due to the consistency of the water flow that will never let you hit the end of the spa.</p>
<p>As always when making a major purchase, however, it is essential to do your research and check that you are purchasing a good quality swim spa which will last a long time and be safe to use. Chlorine and bromine are both excellent sanitizers used in spas and hot tubs. Indoor hot tubs eliminate the awkwardness of using the tub in front of neighbors or passersby. Cushioned headrests, ergonomic seats, and a host of high-performance features make this the ultimate home spa experience.</p>
