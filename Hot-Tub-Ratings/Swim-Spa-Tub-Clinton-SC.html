<p>In our modern, high-tech society, everything gets reviewed these days. As you are swimming in the sea you should not try to work harder than you would in a regular pool. Hot tubs are usually located outdoors, although they can be installed indoors. This is a patented technology; hence, you will not find this technology in any other ordinary swim spas. Using heat and the element of massage, Healthy Living Hot Tubs create one-of-a-kind hydrotherapy to ease aches and pain, calm stress and boost the natural healing response.</p>
<p>It is important to note, though, that the overall size of a swim spa is different from the amount of usable swimming space it contains. Most swim spas found in Canada fall into the mid-range category; costing between $20,000-$35,000. Your swim spa will be the perfect outlet for relaxation, leisure, fun with family. The temperature in an unheated walk-in tub drops to 98.6 in 10 minutes, requiring the bather to add more hot water to remain comfortable.</p>
<p>The Antigua spa, with a diameter of 2.78 metres, has a groundbreaking octagonal design that adds that extra touch of luxury and distinction, which is so prized in hotels, residential complexes, beauty centres, spas, etc. No matter how you design you Jacuzzi Hot Tub, you are sure the durable finishes will last you many years to come. Others have large pools with a diving board at one end above the water. Easy, the gunk collects on the under side of the spa cover and causes unpleasant odors and will ultimately shorten the life of your cover.</p>
