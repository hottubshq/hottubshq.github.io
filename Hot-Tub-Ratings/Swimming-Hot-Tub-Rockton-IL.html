<p>As you are swimming in the sea you should not try to work harder than you would in a regular pool. Hot tubs are usually located outdoors, although they can be installed indoors. This is a patented technology; hence, you will not find this technology in any other ordinary swim spas. Using heat and the element of massage, Healthy Living Hot Tubs create one-of-a-kind hydrotherapy to ease aches and pain, calm stress and boost the natural healing response.</p>
<p>According to Wikipedia : a Hot Tub is a large tub or small pool full of heated water and used for hydrotherapy or pleasure. Add warmth and water movement and hot tubbing becomes the stuff of lifetime memories. If you do use a hot tub, turn down the temperature and limit your time in the water to less than 10 minutes. A Spa system will use air to push the water around your bath and create that bubble and whirl effects.</p>
<p>Due to the advanced design and high-grade materials that's used to craft each and every Hydropool Swim Spa, they can offer many years of use.

However, like a spa, it is equipped with spa jets, so you can enjoy the benefits of relaxation and pain relief that hydrotherapy offers. This is why we have designed our swim spas from the ground up to be used all year.</p>
