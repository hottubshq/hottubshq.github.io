<p>Riptide swim spas and exercise pools delivered and installed by our experienced team. Hot water is a great way to keep the body moving. A Jacuzzi soaking tub is the most common type of tub, and this basic concept is Jacuzzi's foundation for hydrotherapy tubs. Some hot tubs also come with features that Jacuzzi products do not, such as flat-screen TVs and built-in MP3 audio systems. Our Swim Spa River Jets are each powered solely by a 4 HP (6BHP) Hyper Flow Jet Pump. Having the swim spa completely above ground is another option that allows you to fence only the steps (as long as the swim spa is over 1200mm high the height of pool fencing).</p>
<p>Hot tubs are becoming very popular due to their many benefits. Don't jump straight from the hot tub into the pool to cool off. The tub will have a wooden seat or bench running around the walls, so that it's easy for people to sit down and relax. Hydrotherapy is a treatment you can avail of in a hot tub for relaxation with the combination of heat, massage and buoyancy. For that reason, most people have no idea what a swim spa really costs.</p>
<p>These tubs have a 75 gallon capacity and is a great soaker bath to ease the stress away. First, by insulating the cabinet instead of the shell, Vortex spas recycles lost heat from the pumps and equipment, it also insulates the plumbing that would otherwise lose heat to the environment. Obviously when outside the Hot tub will be more exposed to the elements and you will need to wear bath slippers or equivalent as you walk to the Jacuzzi to keep the water as clear as possible.</p>

The features usually include illumination, jets ergonomic seating, control panels, and the dual-zone for heating to offer a dual experience of the hot tub to relax and another zone of the swim section for workouts.</p>
<p>This flexibility has allowed thousands of people to realize the dream of "endless" swimming at their own home. Quite simply, a Swim Spa is a machine that allows you to swim continuously against a water current. During the mid-2000's, a few keen hot tub manufacturers saw that there might be a larger market opening up in the Swim Spa industry, and a number of them changed their production lines to also produce the larger, more bulky Swim Spas.</p>

<p>Adding a Vortex Hybrid Heat Pump to your spa will give you the lowest possible heating costs. Ideal for full-body relief, the J-475 JACUZZI® Hot Tub's 5-6 seat configuration offers the ultimate in style with a relaxing, extra-wide illuminated waterfall, plus an at-a-glance indicator light, color touch screen control panel, and stunning Pro-Finish cabinetry accented by corner lighting. They're also great for socializing, since you don't need to run the swimming jets all the time.</p>
<p>Indoor tubs may produce some moisture when in use, particularly if the ambient room temperature is much less than the water inside the vessel (hot tub water temperatures range from 100-104 degrees F). Those planning an indoor installation need to think about how long they'll use it and perhaps consider installing an exhaust fan to pull moisture from the room. The water inside a swim spa can provide a much more comfortable and enjoyable environment for low-impact exercise.</p>
<p>In terms of price, portable hot tubs are more affordable than regular hot tubs. This allows a person, or pet, to soak in warm, relaxing water, while still swimming and exercising against a legitimate current and with plenty of space. An apple cider vinegar soak in a hot tub can help stop itching skin related to allergies or other dermatitis, as well as helping to take the heat out of a sunburn. A 2018 article on the company's website lists the health benefits people with no serious ailments can derive from a home swim spa: improved sleep, reduced stress, faster recovery from injuries, weight maintenance, reduced muscle pain, increased muscle strength and better flexibility.</p>
<p>As you are swimming in the sea you should not try to work harder than you would in a regular pool. Hot tubs are usually located outdoors, although they can be installed indoors. This is a patented technology; hence, you will not find this technology in any other ordinary swim spas. Using heat and the element of massage, Healthy Living Hot Tubs create one-of-a-kind hydrotherapy to ease aches and pain, calm stress and boost the natural healing response.</p>
