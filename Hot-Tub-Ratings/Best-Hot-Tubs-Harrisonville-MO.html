<p>A Swim Spa is both a swimming pool and a spa or hot tub. Jacuzzi hot tub brings the health benefits relieves sree, improve your sleep, soothes muscles & joints. Most swim spas can be properly adjusted to cater for every style of swimming technique. Since 1995, Nordic has led the industry in providing high quality, therapeutic hot tubs. From pure relaxation to therapeutic, Massage Therapy will help drain the tension from your body and the stress from your mind. There is ample space for your daily swim and workout, and water circulates with ease.</p>
<p>Hot tubs are becoming very popular due to their many benefits. Don't jump straight from the hot tub into the pool to cool off. The tub will have a wooden seat or bench running around the walls, so that it's easy for people to sit down and relax. Hydrotherapy is a treatment you can avail of in a hot tub for relaxation with the combination of heat, massage and buoyancy. For that reason, most people have no idea what a swim spa really costs.</p>

<p>Just remember: no matter how cool the wood hot tubs might look, they are extremely difficult to maintain, so choose something to really ease your stress and not something that will double the work in your home. You can dive into the pool for some exercise and then back into the hot tub where you can warm up and relax your muscles after the invigorating workout.

If you are buying the swim spa for a family-type, year-round pool, you might not worry too much about having a strong current.</p>
<p>Since private pools are used exclusively by a few people, these swimming pools are usually smaller than public pools. Spa and hot tub water therapies are highly valued for their relaxing, rejuvenating, and naturally rehabilitative qualities, and hot tubs remain a favorite social setting.
