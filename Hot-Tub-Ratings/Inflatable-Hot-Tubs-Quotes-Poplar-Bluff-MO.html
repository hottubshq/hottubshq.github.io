<p>Hydrotherapy and Jacuzzi hot tubs seem to go hand and hand these days. The Endless Pools Fitness Systems shell has a modern style with clean lines that flow gracefully from end to end. Built from the highest quality acrylic, Endless Pools swim spas are designed to provide years of family fun and enjoyment. The Jacuzzi brother's patent ran out 10 years later in 1976 which lead to the American hot tub market taking off as they were able to use the Jacuzzi type jets. The original hydrotherapy jet was invented by the Jacuzzi® brothers in 1956.</p>
<p>All of Jacuzzi® hot tubs comply with the California Energy Commission standards of energy efficiency. According to another article by the CDC, you should use pool test strips to check your spa water's pH and free chlorine or free bromine concentration. It seats up to 6 people with a whopping 35 jets including 5 hydro-massage seat jets for maximum luxury. A general rule of thumb is that the water heater should be no less than two-thirds the size of the water capacity of the tub.</p>
<p>The warm water inside the tub can relax spasms, alleviate sprains, backache, and fatigue. This allow you to run your heat pump from your spa controller (not via a separate touchpad), use both heat pump AND electric heater for extra fast heating and extends the life of the heat pump. The heat eases out the tension built up in the muscles and increases the blood flow, which in turn heals the body. With 60 years of experience in manufacturing and a legacy of quality products, you can trust that Jacuzzi® understands quality and is focused on customer satisfaction.</p>

<p>The next part would be the swimming pool part. Now here's where it gets a little confusing, so stay with me. Whirlpool Bath is a trade name owned by Jacuzzi for their brand of jetted tubs, as in a Jacuzzi Whirlpool Bath for the master bath. Flexible PVC piping is used in all quality spas. He considers swim spa workouts an excellent way for seniors to improve their fitness. Run it to the spa and fill with hot water.</p>
<p>You want to stay hydrated while soaking and drinking a cool glass” of water, fruit juice or tea is such a pleasant way to go. But it's so easy to drop a glass” made of glass and have it shatter on the way to the tub or once you're soaking. Hot tubs are usually heated using an electric or natural gas heater, though there are also submersible wood fire hot tub heaters, as well as solar hot water systems. This includes a self-cleaning option and an independent heater so your water heater does not take such a beating every time it tries to fill up the tub.</p>
<p>If you've ever wondered what a hot tub is, the simplest definition comes from ancient times when the tubs were made of wood and their purpose was water treatment. Most importantly, cheap swim spas are prone to shell failure which will require a potential warranty claim if it needs to be replaced. The dealer from whom you are buying the hot tubs must have all the information related to the maintenance. Swim spas are mostly shaped like a traditional swimming pool, but they also include jets like a hot tub.</p>
