But these jets create a current for you to swim against to strengthen muscle groups and extend your endurance. Deluxe 6-person hot tub with 20 hydrotherapy massage jets. One unusual ailment linked to Jacuzzis is "hot tub lung," a lung disease caused by bacteria that can thrive in warm water.</p>
<p>Jacuzzi is simply a brand name of hot tub. Deluxe 6-person hot tub with 40 hydrotherapy massage jets and a full body lounge. Swim spa: This is a small pool that uses powerful jets to propel water toward you so you can get a workout by swimming against the tide, so to speak. These signs should make you a lot more cautious about buying that particular hot tub, although more often than not a lack of treating the water will not harm the performance of the spa.</p>

<p>It's also possible that you might be wanting to build a permanent hydrotherapy pool maybe as an addition to your own pool in your garden in which case this would be referred to as a spa. Swim spas usually only have seating at one end with 2 or 4 powerful swim jets at the other. If you're thinking about investing in a swim spa, you're probably interested in its health and exercise benefits. The water is hot and the jets are powerful which I find amazing for a 110 V appliance.</p>
<p>The difference with swim spas is that they're often larger than a standard spa pool and have an open area at one end without seating. If an Extreme Lighting Package is installed on your spa, each corner will light up to match the color of light in your hot tub. When you allow the massaging jets to massage your sore spots or even just hold your feet up to the circulating massaging water you will immediately feel better and your feet won't hurt much at all.</p>

Chemicals used to clean and disinfect hot tubs may cause allergic reactions in some people.

<p>Although in the water, swimming is a strenuous sport that can induce dehydration - especially when one is swimming for long periods of time. They are ideal as individual features, as part of your spa area, or alongside a sauna, steam room or pool. At the same time, in the water, you have an extra resistance to move against which gives you the ultimate benefits of your workout sessions without even sensing it. Letting your mind go without any worries is mentally comforting to get the maximum workout experience.</p>
