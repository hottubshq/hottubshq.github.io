<p>Modern homes are starting to take advantage of the corner bathtubs concept. The hotel facility includes an indoor swimming pool, a whirlpool , a sauna, massages, a children's playground and free parking. Keep in mind both swim spas and spas are optimised for different water types, depending on your preference. The trees and fence that you see at the west end start shading the spa from 1.30pm onwards at the spa seat end of the pool which has made it very comfortable during hot summer days.</p>
<p>Today Jacuzzis are normally found in residential homes, hotels suites, aboard cruise ships, and in the spas sprinkled in all parts of the world. The intensity and direction of the hydromassages, the water temperature regulation and the jets number are managed through a digital control board for the hydrotherapy to be efficient. You want the very latest in design whereby the Jets provide a vigorous massage to loosen those tight knotted muscles and at the same time increase the blood and oxygen circulation which helps to bring nutrients to sore muscles and joints.</p>
<p>If you are planning to heat your swim spa for some or all of the year the best way to do this is with a heat pump which can heat (and potentially cool) your spa - providing total control over the water temperature for under $10 a week. It's important to note that some insurance providers simply won't cover you with the additional risk that a hot tub introduces. We recommend that you consult a plumber to calculate precisely what size water heater you'll need for a walk-in tub so you won't shortchange the rest of your household while bathing.</p>

Ozone clarification is a proven technology that has been used for decades to automatically clarify spa and pool water. They also have other features you can include in your Jacuzzi® spa , like a waterfall element or LED lights for a soothing chromatherapy experience.</p>
