<p>A dip in the warm water of a hot tub can help to soothe tight, sore muscles, and ending a date in the Jacuzzi might allow couples to relax and share intimate time in a whole new way. It has separate temperature controls for the swimming lane and hot tub which means that someone can be comfortably practicing their stroke at a swimming pool temperature while others can be seated in warmer waters in the hot tub area. Unlike pools, you can change the current intensity to suit any swimming level you desire. Hot tub accidents or injuries for home residents are not covered; that falls under your health insurance plan.</p>
<p>The reason most people opt for a swim spa is that they don't have enough room for a full-sized swimming pool.

<p>Compared to a pool, the ratio of people to volume of water is drastically different to in a spa, prompting unexpected spikes in pH. A jump in pH can cause the water to become alkaline and cloudy, leading to scale build up in your spa. In addition, swimming can be great for runners recovering from injuries since it not only helps maintain good physical health but also improves mental health. The insulation around the cabinet traps in waste heat created by the pumps and heater, greatly increasing the energy efficiency of the swim spa as a whole.</p>

<p>When you exercise in one of these spas, you will be utilizing every muscle group in your body in a controlled setting. Given that the skill level to install a Jacuzzi bathtub is fairly high, most homeowners hire a pro. It produces a certain water current that allows you to swim there for as long as you want without hitting any walls. We had a jacuzzi tub in our old home and the jets never seemed clean no matter what I tried.</p>
<p>Initially, they took to soaking in hot water filled wine barrels and other large wooden vessels and they, logically enough, called these hot tubs. When you use a sauna, jacuzzi, hot tub or steam room, your body is unable to lose heat effectively by sweating. The acidic quality of vinegar eats away at oily residue that has built up in the tub as well as the calcium and other chemical deposits in the jets and tubing.</p>
<p>Due to the fact that heat rises, it is the spa cover that contains this heat.
