The hot moving water in the Jacuzzi soothes your muscles. This jet driven swim spa is one of the largest and most powerful on the market while providing the space and functionality for an entire family. It is a whole lot easier to climb into a hot tub than it is to pull yourself out over the slippery water filled sides so that cover will help prevent any sort of accident if you leave it open and unattended.</p>
