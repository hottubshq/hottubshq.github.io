The Bellavista collection comes in your choice of rectangular and triangular shapes, and is available in all four of Jacuzzi's luxury tub experiences: Soaking Bath, Pure Air, Whirlpool, and Salon Spa.</p>
<p>We already know that the tubs can promote better blood circulation. It is also time to start filling the hot tub.

Vinegar can be used as a cleaning agent for hot tubs and is gentle enough that it will not harm any of the working parts or the tub itself.</p>
<p>Just remember: no matter how cool the wood hot tubs might look, they are extremely difficult to maintain, so choose something to really ease your stress and not something that will double the work in your home. You can dive into the pool for some exercise and then back into the hot tub where you can warm up and relax your muscles after the invigorating workout.

<p>Your swim spa should be heat pump ready” and you should try and buy a swim spa with a heat pump compatible controller. In a Swim Spa, you are swimming in place as water rushes past you causing a loss of buoyancy that would be normally produced as you pull yourself up and over static water with every stroke. This then pairs with a bigger pump which is in charge of fueling the spas jets. They then managed to create a swimming spa which is more convenient to use compared to outdoor activities.</p>
