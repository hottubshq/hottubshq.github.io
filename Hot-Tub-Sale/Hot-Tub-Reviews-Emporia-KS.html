<p>Family owned Sacramento dealer offering affordable high quality Turbo Spas and Swim Spas. You are probably thinking, Yeah, this sounds great, but it probably costs like a trillion dollars.” That is a common misconception about Swim Spas…that they are only for the fabulously wealthy. Illumatherapy also offers four points of entry, with two on each side of the tub, and air bubbles spraying from the jets give the appearance of dancing as they reflect the light. The blowers make the hot tub feel like you've got your own personal geyser - forcing air from the bottom of the pool, and creating a very relaxing environment for you.</p>
<p>Swimlife is in the swimspa business for life and the only way to ensure success is to produce, offer and innovate the highest quality swimspas possible. Also, swim spas require a metal frame for support (which does not like being underground) and have the equipment (which requires access) inside the cabinet. Above ground hot tubs are freestanding basins that can be positioned anywhere, provided that there is connection to electric energy.</p>
<p>If you are planning to heat your swim spa for some or all of the year the best way to do this is with a heat pump which can heat (and potentially cool) your spa - providing total control over the water temperature for under $10 a week. It's important to note that some insurance providers simply won't cover you with the additional risk that a hot tub introduces. We recommend that you consult a plumber to calculate precisely what size water heater you'll need for a walk-in tub so you won't shortchange the rest of your household while bathing.</p>
