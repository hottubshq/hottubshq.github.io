<p>Riptide swim spas and exercise pools delivered and installed by our experienced team. Hot water is a great way to keep the body moving. A Jacuzzi soaking tub is the most common type of tub, and this basic concept is Jacuzzi's foundation for hydrotherapy tubs. Some hot tubs also come with features that Jacuzzi products do not, such as flat-screen TVs and built-in MP3 audio systems. Our Swim Spa River Jets are each powered solely by a 4 HP (6BHP) Hyper Flow Jet Pump. Having the swim spa completely above ground is another option that allows you to fence only the steps (as long as the swim spa is over 1200mm high the height of pool fencing).</p>
<p>With the burgeoning interest in health and leisure across the United States, yet another opportunity was spotted in the 1960s, by Roy Jacuzzi, who invented and marketed the first self-contained, fully-integrated whirlpool bath, creating a whole new industry almost on his own. In short, hot tubs and Jacuzzis are not the same. Tests have proven that through having a heat pump within your spa pool or swim spa, running costs are reduced by over 50%, resulting in shortened and achievable payback period.</p>
<p>With a PDC Spas swim or fitness spa just footsteps away, you can achieve your personal health and exercise goals with the added resistance of our TruSwim® dual propulsion hydraulic, superior jetted swim or fitness currents. For most people, swim spas are still a relatively new concept. RELAX AND UNWIND IN HOT TUB MODE BY REDIRECTING THE WATER JETS FOR AN OPTIMAL HOT TUB EXPERIENCE. Clean, well-maintained hot tubs do not cause utis all by themselves.</p>
<h2>Backyard Hot Tub Gunnison Colorado</h2>
<p>The two-in-one design of these fitness and exercise pools gives you the best of both worlds through gentle resistance for laps and after you're finished-hydromassaging jets to soothe your muscles. Audio and visual options are offered in the majority of spa pool and swim spa deals today. The filtration system in your spa pool is vital for providing you with pristine water. The features usually include illumination, jets ergonomic seating, control panels, and the dual-zone for heating to offer a dual experience of the hot tub to relax and another zone of the swim section for workouts.</p>
<p>The deep penetrating moist heat relaxes the muscles and expands the blood vessels, creating a sedative effect on the nervous system. Hydrotherapy in a hot tub provides relief for high blood pressure because it dilates or opens up blood vessels so the heart doesn't have to pump as hard. Enjoy the benefits of aquatic fitness in the comfort and privacy of your home, with a variety of low-impact activities to keep your body limber and feeling good.</p>
<h3>The Secret Of Energy Efficient Swimming Pools Gunnison</h3>
<p>We consider the styles and sizes of swim spas each company makes as well as the number of spas available, the kinds of water jet propulsion systems used and price range. Our research shows PDC Spas is the best place to buy a swim spa because of its large selection, strong swim current systems, quick customer service and many fun options. Another important task is testing and adjusting the alkalinity of the water because if your water is hard, you'll end up having to replace swim spa parts.</p>
<p>The difference with swim spas is that they're often larger than a standard spa pool and have an open area at one end without seating. If an Extreme Lighting Package is installed on your spa, each corner will light up to match the color of light in your hot tub. When you allow the massaging jets to massage your sore spots or even just hold your feet up to the circulating massaging water you will immediately feel better and your feet won't hurt much at all.</p>
<p>This smart design, combined with an R-value of 20 and a one-pound foam density, makes our Swim Spa Michael Phelps cover a great option for cold-weather climates. There are both indoor and outdoor versions of hot tubs. Designed for performance, not to mention your well being, the revolutionary current-generator in the E-Series is the ultimate in swim spa technology. For the first time ever, an infinity (or vanishing) edge is available in a portable full-size Swim Spa.</p>
