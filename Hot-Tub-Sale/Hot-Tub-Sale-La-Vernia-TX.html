<p>Did you know that a swimming pool is not only fun to swim and relax in? Aside from the consideration of a spa's heat pump, the insulation within a spa pool determines how much output energy is required to maintain it. There are three main insulation systems used today, it is dependable on the company, manufacturer and model as to which one is adopted.

Obviously when outside the Hot tub will be more exposed to the elements and you will need to wear bath slippers or equivalent as you walk to the Jacuzzi to keep the water as clear as possible.</p>
