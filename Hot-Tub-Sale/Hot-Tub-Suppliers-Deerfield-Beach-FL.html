<p>If you are unfamiliar with a swim spa, then just the title is enough to make you wonder what it is and how it can benefit you. First this is something that can help you solve a lot of the problems of the day as you take the time to relax in your hot tub at home after a long days drive, or a long day at the office. The portion in which you can swim laps are what makes a swim spa uniquely different from a hot tub alone. For more intensive swimming pool cleaning services, purchase a small, portable pump to remove standing water from the cover.</p>
<p>All of Jacuzzi® hot tubs comply with the California Energy Commission standards of energy efficiency. According to another article by the CDC, you should use pool test strips to check your spa water's pH and free chlorine or free bromine concentration. It seats up to 6 people with a whopping 35 jets including 5 hydro-massage seat jets for maximum luxury. A general rule of thumb is that the water heater should be no less than two-thirds the size of the water capacity of the tub.</p>
<p>The three different kinds of containers used for hot tubs are wooden barrels, fibreglass whirlpools, or large bathtubs. Michael Phelps Signature Swim Spas were developed with input from 23-time gold medalist Michael Phelps and his coach Bob Bowman for all types of training, swimming, fitness programs and aquatic therapy.
