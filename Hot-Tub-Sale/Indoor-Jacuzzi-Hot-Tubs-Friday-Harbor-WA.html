<p>When people refer to a hot tub or a spa, they often think of the word Jacuzzi. When you exercise in one of these spas, you will be utilizing every muscle group in your body in a controlled setting. Given that the skill level to install a Jacuzzi bathtub is fairly high, most homeowners hire a pro. It produces a certain water current that allows you to swim there for as long as you want without hitting any walls. We had a jacuzzi tub in our old home and the jets never seemed clean no matter what I tried.</p>
<p>Take your soaking experience to the next level by adding Jacuzzi® Epsom Salt to your bathing ritual. Some swimming pool cleaning services experts recommend reducing pump operation to one hour per day until normal filtration cycle time is reached. Swim, exercise and relax with friends and family from the comforts and convenience of home. With multiple pumps you also get more and stronger massage jets as you can divert the water from the swim jets to the massage seats when you are not swimming.</p>
<p>The new Coleman SaluSpa Inflatable AirJet Hot Tub bucks the trend of circular hot tubs in favor of a more square-shaped design, but it's able to provide 114 air jets to pamper you in relaxing heated water, up the the 104 degree maximum temperature. Our SwimCross Exercise System combines a five-speed jetted resistance current with smart features to deliver a complete fitness program for all ages. Neck and back pain, sports injuries, muscle pulls, spasms and soreness are often eased simply by a quick dip in your hot tub.</p>

The swimming pool alternative for any backyard. They can be above ground (like one of our portable spas shown here), they can be sunk into an indoor floor or outdoor deck, or they can even be part of an inground swimming pool (known as a pool and spa combo).</p>
<p>Approved safety locks - A quality approved locking cover is just as accepted as a fully fenced spa pool. Since every policy is a little different in their treatment of hot tubs, make sure you check with your insurance provider or read your policy to make sure you understand the specifics of your coverage. It might even be called a spa as in the Lay zee spa brand in the UK, but, if it's freestanding, semi-permanent and has inbuilt filtration and heating then it's a hot tub.</p>
<h3>Hot Spring Spas & Hot Tubs Friday Harbor</h3>
<p>We feature jetted hot tubs built into attractive wooden decks with the hot natural mineral water flowing constantly to them from deep inside the earth. They are slightly larger than traditional bathtubs and have features similar to fiberglass whirlpools. Besides those benefits, swimming spas can also help your heart and lungs. As the name itself suggest, you could take portable hot tubs with you when you decide to relocate.</p>
<p>Specialty treatments at Hot Springs Resort and Spa are a true experience in decadence. Likewise, if you plan to use your swim spa mainly for exercise, you might want to consider a spa that has an easy to control current that allows you to change the current to various strengths. The health benefits of aquatic exercise are well known as movement in water benefits body and mind. Discover pro grade performance with Jacuzzi® Pro Grade Pool Equipment and Cleaners.</p>
<p>The drastic price difference while having the same benefits give swim spas an advantage over the other options. There are Hot tub on the marketplace now that are designed for two people only; therefore the tubs are much smaller to the traditional larger hot tubs. These smaller sized swim spas can still accommodate several bathers, although if you're taller than average it might feel a little small. Another great characteristic that comes with owning a swim spa is that its maintenance is so much easier then it would be with owning a swimming pool.</p>
