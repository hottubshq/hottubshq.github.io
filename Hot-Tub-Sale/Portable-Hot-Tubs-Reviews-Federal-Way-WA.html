<p>Jacuzzis are among the most popular addition to a luxury bathroom. The choice ranges from more classic wood-covered hot tubs, for a timeless elegance, to the most glamorous ones with faux leather covering, conceived to resist bed weather. There are hot tubs suitable for very small spaces and even unusual geometric designs. Swim spas, on the other hand, offer you the two options that you can choose from to suit the weather. Some of the features to look for in a swimspa that can provide this type of an experience are fitness related.</p>
<p>It is important to note, though, that the overall size of a swim spa is different from the amount of usable swimming space it contains. Most swim spas found in Canada fall into the mid-range category; costing between $20,000-$35,000. Your swim spa will be the perfect outlet for relaxation, leisure, fun with family. The temperature in an unheated walk-in tub drops to 98.6 in 10 minutes, requiring the bather to add more hot water to remain comfortable.</p>
<p>In fact, most larger swim spas will even have a separate section that mimics a hot tub, offering a dual-purpose experience. Many agree that having a Jacuzzi walk-in tub has noticeably improved their quality of life. Their Simple hot tub Care®, system is an easy-to-follow program that is simple to use, but does for your hot tub exactly what needs to be done. Swim spas have it all—aquatic exercise, relaxation and fun for all ages from the comforts, privacy and convenience of home.</p>

<p>This pool's small size means less water and less water means smaller heating costs and fewer chemicals - a savings on both time and money. Through the late 80's and the 90's I continued selling and installing primarily inground, or built in” swim spas. Old fashioned hot tub manufacturers and indeed those hot tubs that are not made to the very latest designs and standards use linked, jet-to-jet plumbing systems which can often result in the very first jet in the line being very powerful and the last jet being much less so.</p>
