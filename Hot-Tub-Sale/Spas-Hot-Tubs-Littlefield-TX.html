It is advisable for people suffering from diarrhea, skin infections, intestinal infections or fresh wounds on any part of the body not to use the hot tubs. The average price of Jacuzzi bathtubs are based on their size, whether the unit can still be used as a standup shower and the number of jets they include. The lining of the Jacuzzi tub or swim spa is usually made from fiberglass or acrylic.</p>
