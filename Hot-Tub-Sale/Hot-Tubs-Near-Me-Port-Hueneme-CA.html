<p>Spas and Hot tubs have enjoyed huge popularity of the last few years. This is a spa that is offered at a fitness club or a recreational club as an added facility. Unlike a swimming pool which can be quite costly to install and requires a large backyard, swim spas offer this all-in-one portable package in a box that can be craned into position in an hour. If you plan to heat your swim spa regularly, especially the swim end due to the large amount of water, you need to be able to use a gas or a heat pump as the electric heaters will be very expensive.</p>
<p>With the burgeoning interest in health and leisure across the United States, yet another opportunity was spotted in the 1960s, by Roy Jacuzzi, who invented and marketed the first self-contained, fully-integrated whirlpool bath, creating a whole new industry almost on his own. In short, hot tubs and Jacuzzis are not the same. Tests have proven that through having a heat pump within your spa pool or swim spa, running costs are reduced by over 50%, resulting in shortened and achievable payback period.</p>
<p>This new and innovative way to take your swim spa cover on and off makes swim spa sessions easier than ever. Jacuzzi developed the first hot tub pump 60 years ago and continues to provide innovative hydrotherapy products and features. For the ultimate in relaxation, a whirlpool bath is absolutely ideal for easing muscle tension & improving blood circulation, and now it's even easier to upgrade than ever. Be sure when ordering an Aqua Flow Viton seal kit that it will match the pump used in your Cal Spa, Marquis, Clearwater, Coleman or other spa brand that from time to time has used Aqua Flo pumps in their spas.</p>
