<p>When you install your hot tub on the deck and start to enjoy it, it is then you realize that you need to have a gazebo or an enclosure to give you privacy from prying eye when you are inside. Note: Our swim spas are fully plumbed and mechanically assembled, ready for use other than a couple of final connections at the site. But one exercise that never goes out of style is swimming. Swimming is exercise, and with any exercise we are losing moisture from the body - and it is important to replenish this moisture. Clearwater Spas warrants the operating equipment and plumbing against defects in workmanship for five years from the original purchase date.</p>

Whether it be relaxing in one of many different spas and hot tubs, enjoying a soothing sauna tub, this can help make your family gatherings a joy.</p>
<p>And while a number of studies have touted the benefits of swimming over every other form of exercise (including jogging and walking!), and include swimming as a recommended form of exercise for everything from increasing the chances of conception in women to easing the suffering of those with Fibromyalgia, very few insurance plans offer any sort of coverage or assistance when making the purchase of a swimming spa.</p>
