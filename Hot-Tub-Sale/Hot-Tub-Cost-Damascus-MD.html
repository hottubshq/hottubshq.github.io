The benefits of hydrotherapy, whether in a swimming pool, or in a spa, are wide-spread.</p>
<p>The areas around the pump and tubes need clearance as well in case any repairs are needed down the line. If the pH level becomes too low, the water will become acidic, irritating the skin of swimmers and causing corrosive damage to your spa or pool.
