Jacuzzi TargetPro jets are fully adjustable and customizable and designed to direct the whirlpool action to any desired target area.

<p>Some models use an air blower to force air through a separate set of jets for a different "bubbly" massage effect; this is a separate system from the induced air. Whether your choice of exercise is running, walking, jogging, or working out at the gym, the fitness of hot tubs and spas are just what you need for those tired, aching muscles at affordable prices. This process is particularly crucial for spas which are manufactured in extreme weather environments e.g., very hot, very cold or humid conditions.</p>

A pump with a higher horsepower is going to cost you more - so make sure that you understand how much force you need to apply to suck the water in.
