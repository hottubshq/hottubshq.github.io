<p>Hydrotherapy and Jacuzzi hot tubs seem to go hand and hand these days. The Endless Pools Fitness Systems shell has a modern style with clean lines that flow gracefully from end to end. Built from the highest quality acrylic, Endless Pools swim spas are designed to provide years of family fun and enjoyment. The Jacuzzi brother's patent ran out 10 years later in 1976 which lead to the American hot tub market taking off as they were able to use the Jacuzzi type jets. The original hydrotherapy jet was invented by the Jacuzzi® brothers in 1956.</p>
<p>These same rules apply at residential spas, hot tubs and pools, too. Hot tub folliculitis is a type of skin infection on the hair follicles which is brought about by immersion in a hot tub with unclean water. If you break out in itchy spots after using a hot tub, you may have "hot tub rash." It's one of the more common illnesses linked to hot tubs , according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).</p>
<p>If you are looking to have a swimming pool and hot tub combination, a two tank swim spa might be your best option. Swim spas require a solid, level surface to sit on and an electrical supply line (usually 220 volt, similar to a hot tub). We believe the best way to deliver great service is to represent the number 1 hot tub brand in the world - Jacuzzi. In fact, some studies suggest aquatic exercise may be more effective than on-land workouts for some people with back ailments, according to an article by Rena Goldman in Pool & Spa News Like with osteoarthritis and bone and joints ailments, the secret here lies in the reduction of pressure on your joints provided by the buoyancy of the water.</p>
