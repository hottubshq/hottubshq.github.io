<p>When you install your hot tub on the deck and start to enjoy it, it is then you realize that you need to have a gazebo or an enclosure to give you privacy from prying eye when you are inside. Note: Our swim spas are fully plumbed and mechanically assembled, ready for use other than a couple of final connections at the site. But one exercise that never goes out of style is swimming. Swimming is exercise, and with any exercise we are losing moisture from the body - and it is important to replenish this moisture. Clearwater Spas warrants the operating equipment and plumbing against defects in workmanship for five years from the original purchase date.</p>

<p>The latest hot tubs have superior ozone systems resulting in the use of much less chemicals. This open-concept tank is large enough to offer many of the benefits that swimming pools do. Often, companies that offer swimming pool cleaning services recommend lowering the water level for winterizing. Key questions to answer when shopping for a hot tub are how many people will be using it at one time, and where you plan to place your hot tub.</p>

<p>2nd Day Air Shipping not available for chemicals, spas, and other items that normally ship by freight. 1. choose pumps with single speed jet and circulation, 2.
