<p>We all know that buying hot tubs isn't a joke. It's also possible that you might be wanting to build a permanent hydrotherapy pool maybe as an addition to your own pool in your garden in which case this would be referred to as a spa. Swim spas usually only have seating at one end with 2 or 4 powerful swim jets at the other. If you're thinking about investing in a swim spa, you're probably interested in its health and exercise benefits. The water is hot and the jets are powerful which I find amazing for a 110 V appliance.</p>
<p>If you've ever wondered what a hot tub is, the simplest definition comes from ancient times when the tubs were made of wood and their purpose was water treatment. Most importantly, cheap swim spas are prone to shell failure which will require a potential warranty claim if it needs to be replaced. The dealer from whom you are buying the hot tubs must have all the information related to the maintenance. Swim spas are mostly shaped like a traditional swimming pool, but they also include jets like a hot tub.</p>
<p>You can use a smartphone app to run your swim spa from afar, opt for a speaker system and even a fancy cover to protect your investment. Hot tubs are also found at natural hot springs ; in this case, the water may be dangerously hot and must be combined with cool water for a safe soaking temperature. These days, Jacuzzi employs nearly 5,000 people worldwide and has become the name we most associate with whirlpool baths.</p>

This way, even though there is not an extensive amount of swimming space in a swim spa, you can still enjoy the improved health, fitness and muscle strength that swimming provides.
