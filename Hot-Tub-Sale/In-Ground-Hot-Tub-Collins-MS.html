<p>Jacuzzis are among the most popular addition to a luxury bathroom. The choice ranges from more classic wood-covered hot tubs, for a timeless elegance, to the most glamorous ones with faux leather covering, conceived to resist bed weather. There are hot tubs suitable for very small spaces and even unusual geometric designs. Swim spas, on the other hand, offer you the two options that you can choose from to suit the weather. Some of the features to look for in a swimspa that can provide this type of an experience are fitness related.</p>
<p>The water hot temperature, the massage made by swiveling water jets and the ergonomic shape of the hot tub bring down the body tension and soothe your muscles. Swim spas with paddlewheels are the most expensive design and usually cost $35,000 or more, but offer an excellent current to swim against. Swim spas are moderately-sized jetted tubs.

<p>A spa or hot tub should be shocked with the appropriate sanitizer after use. Hot tub water chemicals, especially chlorine have a specific formula that lasts in hot water won't turn the water cloudy and has the right pH for hot tubbing.

<p>When hot tubs aren't cleaned well, their moist environment is the perfect breeding ground for bacteria. Although better than low-end swim spas, many mid-range swim spa swim currents still lack power and smoothness To overcome this, the manufacturer will often include a swim tether system to keep you in place and prevent you from out-swimming the current.

<p>Induced air: The jets may use a venturi effect to incorporate air into the water stream for a lighter massage effect; this requires another set of hoses.

<p>Buying a used spa is another way of acquiring a hot tub without paying full price. If the swim spas are not cleaned or maintained from time to time, you will not enjoy the swimming experience due to the dirt collected and the bad odor emitted from the swim spa. One of the most overlooked areas in an all season pool is the ability of the unit to provide benefits outside the swim and massage. These are common pressure areas and jetted bathtubs know how to attack what ails you.</p>
