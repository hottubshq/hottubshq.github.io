<p>Hot tubs are a wonderful excuse for getting out in the garden more often, and with care they can be designed to blend into their surroundings so they don't stick out as an eyesore. Because of this, all spas that use an ozone system should also include a mixing chamber that ensures ozone receives the correct contact time with the water. Eco Spas offers a line of spas that are compact, reasonably priced with an extremely durable shell and cover.</p>
<p>Depending on the model that you choose you can have up to 3 River Jets powered by a total of 12 HP (18 BHP) on our Performance Plus Swim Spa Package. The Endless Pools® hydraulically powered underwater treadmill offers low-impact run or walk options. Swim spas are designed for exercise. If you plan to purchase an indoor hot tub, you should consider where you will install it and the people who will use it most often.</p>
<p>One of the most important Jacuzzi tub accessories is the motor that helps run the jets. Our Swim Spa Suite is the perfect option, as it offers the best physical therapy and romantic therapy all wrapped up in one economical spa package. Most swim spas take up less space than traditional small in-ground pools. A hot tub is (usually) a round wooden tank with a simple bench seat and 4-8 jets around the side. The Great Backyard Place also recommends you give plenty of thought to where you want to put the hot tub or swim spa you buy.</p>
