<p>Today, hot tubs are more popular than ever and the number of hot tub owners is steadily rising. Muscle pain and stiffness cannot remain in your body when the hot, high speed water surrounds you. Most of the hot tubs on Wayfair require a water and electrical source, but if neither are viable in the area where you plan to place your hot tub, a popup hot tub might make more sense. After a swimming work-out you can relax in the spa zone and choose from a lounger seat, a neck and shoulder massage seat, 2 back massage seats or the frequently used cool down seat.</p>
<p>It is important to note, though, that the overall size of a swim spa is different from the amount of usable swimming space it contains. Most swim spas found in Canada fall into the mid-range category; costing between $20,000-$35,000. Your swim spa will be the perfect outlet for relaxation, leisure, fun with family. The temperature in an unheated walk-in tub drops to 98.6 in 10 minutes, requiring the bather to add more hot water to remain comfortable.</p>
<p>Jets are located around the sides of the tub and air injectors are located under the seats. For example, it's easy to see you need to buy a Synergy or a TruSwim swim spa if you want cascading water spouts, not a Vitality model. It lets you swim, exercise, play, and entertain; it's the perfect fun-and-fitness solution for family, friends, and solo retreats. Built tough for the great Aussie outdoors, your spa pool or swim spa will last, backed by our lifetime care commitment.</p>
