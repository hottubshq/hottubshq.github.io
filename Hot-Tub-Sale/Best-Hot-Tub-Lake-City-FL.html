In 1968, Roy Jacuzzi invented the first format of a self-contained, fully integrated whirlpool bath that attracted number of people to luxuriate in its relaxing spray of waters.</p>
<p>Swimming in a swim spa adds extra benefits. That is why if you notice, the jets are usually positioned at the most stressed muscles of the body - the calves, neck, some at the back, and at the sole of the feet. We favored those that sell spas with paddlewheel current systems, since they're usually the strongest. The bath water is recirculated through the jets, which keeps the water a bit warmer than air being forced in the bath.</p>
<p>Many different styles of corner tubs are available, including taller and deeper tubs (much like soaking tubs) give you a full body bath in a quarter of the space (length x width), and it utilizes the often ample space in height in many bathrooms. Swim spas are extremely easy and convenient when it comes to their use, cleaning, and installing. You should always check that all the pumps and blowers are working and that the heater control lights indicate that the heater is on when the spa is calling for heat.</p>
