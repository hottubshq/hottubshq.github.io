<p>Hot tubs are a great way to relax after a long day at work. If you want an inground swim spa installed, you can expect to pay more than these prices, as there is so much extra work involved in installing any pool inground. In many areas you can also commission hot tubs and install wooden swimming pools. Quarrycast is a mineral crystal composite, a new material developed by Victoria & Albert Baths, to enhance your bathing experience: it's warm to the touch, keeping the water in your hot tub hot for a long time; it has a naturally high gloss finish and it can be colored with the dye of your choice, maximizing the interior design options in your bathroom.</p>
<p>As its name suggests, a swim spa pool is basically a cross between a spa and a swimming pool. But even with limited space, a larger swim spa is still much smaller than a full pool while providing a comfortable experience for a decent number of people. When most people go to buy the spas, the first question they have in mind is the cost and the second question is about the power consumption. Swim Spas actually cost a bit more than a portable hot tub spa and a lot less than an inground swimming pool.</p>
<p>These hot tubs are sometimes called Jacuzzi or Whirlpool tubs, though these are actually brand names. Leisurescape Pools & Spas stock a great variety of swim spas. A hot tub pump is made up of two sections. Two 5hp SwimBoost Pumps producing up to 360 gallons per minute per jets and one 3hp Buoyancy Pump. It's easy to set up and features a rapid heating system, which will heat the water to a toasty 40-degrees centigrade (or less, if you desire).</p>
