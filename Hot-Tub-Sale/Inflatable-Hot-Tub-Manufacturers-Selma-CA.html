<p>Hot tubs have been around since ancient Roman and Greek cultures and in Japan from ancient times right through to today. The Helsinki AirJet from Lay-Z-Spa is a Nordic inspired inflatable hot tub which can be used all year-round thanks to the innovative Freeze Shield technology. Swimming spas became popular because of the comfort that it gives to the whole family.

<p>Swim spas definitely are not cheap, but they are about half the price of a nice pool. In pools, you worry about turns, running into the wall, or jumping too deep that you hit the ground, swim spas erase these concerns and the possibility of these incidents. Jacuzzi is the company that brought hydrotherapy to the market more than 50 years ago with their hot tubs, and it is clear they are the leading experts in the industry.</p>
<p>The idea is that you swim in the tub and the current produced by the swim spa pushes against you in much the same way as a treadmill. Putting one on the second floor is not a good idea, unless it is a small bathtub Jacuzzi. Our insulation system harnesses all the heat from the pumps and the heater inside the spa cabinet while reflecting the colder outside air away from the spa. This is why we make Royal Spa Swim Spas from components that can be found at most pool and spa supply stores.</p>

<p>The tiny jets that circle a sauna bath can shoot out water at an incredibly fast rate, and placing the penis in front of those jets could provide men with quite a thrill. Many people who suffered from injuries, especially in their legs, that prevented them from walking properly, have chosen to start learning again how to walk in pools. And secondly, by placing the insulation between the spa's pumps and you, you'll enjoy a quieter, more tranquil and restful spa experience.</p>
<p>Next to chromotherapy, hot tubs can feature built-in sound or aromatherapy systems that, through the use of essential oils or aromatic herbs, have a positive effect on your body and emotional health. Now it is time to enjoy your work, you did good, celebrate in your new hot tub. Hot tubs are usually made of wood, but they can also be made from synthetic wood materials. My husband and I purchased a swim spa from Endless Pools in January this year and are delighted with the outcome.</p>

Programmable sleep timers - This function gives you the control to turn your spa off completely for the duration of the night, avoiding any sleep disturbances for family or neighbors.</p>

<p>It is best to run the water tests everyday to ensure the purity of the hot-tub water. No swimming pool experience would be complete without room for water toys. All Vortex Swim Spas have topside recesses to place your glasses and bottles. Even if you don't feel comfortable doing this in a showroom where the hot tubs are for sale, you should get into the shell and test the comfort level of the seats. Remember that swim spas are mechanical products and like a car you'll need replacement parts from time to time.</p>
<p>Although the larger Jacuzzi family thought this idea was a little weird, the sales grew and soon the bathtub was designed to be a bit larger so as to fit in 2 people. In Jacuzzi an electric heater can be installed to enjoy hot whirling water. Residential or home pools are sometimes built-in or assembled above ground. Many dealerships now display Swim Spas in their stores. We design and manufacture our own hot tubs for public and private use, for indoor or outdoor installation, for frequent or occasional use and for relaxing or to supplement your fitness regime.</p>
<p>Depending on how you use the Hot Tub and the people that actually use it you should fully drain and inspect your hot tub say every three to six months. The paddlewheel current allows people to swim side by side, and there's also an area of still water for people who prefer that. We have installed spa pools across Australia, from Canberra to Brisbane, to Melbourne, Sydney and Adelaide, and everywhere in between.</p>
<p>Chilling out after a stressful work week can be a tad harder then the self-help books make it out to be. This is where the Wood-Fired Hot Tub comes in. It's a portable, free-standing, wood-fired hot tub that accommodates four adults (make that six if you're very friendly). Swimming in swim spas can even improve your social life due to their effect in making you more relaxed and content. Visit Paradise Spas & Outdoor Living, we serve the Greater Austin area, including Cedar Park Texas, and are excited to offer these unique products.</p>
