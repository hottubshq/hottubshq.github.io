<p>Hydropool's Self-Cleaning 570 is a 5 person hot tub that is perfect for two couples. If you're considering an online supplier, Google them to see what type of experiences other customers have had and remember that the cost of the swim spa itself will only be part of the overall cost including delivery, concrete base, fencing and certifier and permit fees. Besides the above there are a few other major differences that can be seen between the two, which we will now take a more in-depth look at, and also approach the benefits that a swim spa can bring.</p>

<p>Popular pump brands include Waterway pumps, Ultra Jet, Vico, Master Series and Hayward. However, Vortex have pioneered it's use in spa pools. There are some disadvantages of swim spas that you should be aware of before deciding on getting one. Made from high-quality materials, these tubs are also chemically inert and nonporous.

<p>Today Jacuzzis are normally found in residential homes, hotels suites, aboard cruise ships, and in the spas sprinkled in all parts of the world. The intensity and direction of the hydromassages, the water temperature regulation and the jets number are managed through a digital control board for the hydrotherapy to be efficient. You want the very latest in design whereby the Jets provide a vigorous massage to loosen those tight knotted muscles and at the same time increase the blood and oxygen circulation which helps to bring nutrients to sore muscles and joints.</p>
<p>Endless Pools was one of the first companies to develop the Swim Spa concept years ago.

<p>They gave me a great price on the hot tub and the entire experience was great. Besides hydromassage, there are hot tubs with chromotherapy that, thanks to underwater lights, emit rays of colored lights able to infuse energy and balance while ameliorating the mood. From jet placement to optimal positioning of the body in ergonomic seats, a JACUZZI® Hot Tub is a showcase in quality design. They soon created a tub with a built-in jet whirlpool, which took off in popularity.</p>
