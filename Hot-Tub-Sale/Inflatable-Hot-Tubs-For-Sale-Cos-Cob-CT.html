<p>Riptide swim spas and exercise pools delivered and installed by our experienced team. Hot water is a great way to keep the body moving. A Jacuzzi soaking tub is the most common type of tub, and this basic concept is Jacuzzi's foundation for hydrotherapy tubs. Some hot tubs also come with features that Jacuzzi products do not, such as flat-screen TVs and built-in MP3 audio systems. Our Swim Spa River Jets are each powered solely by a 4 HP (6BHP) Hyper Flow Jet Pump. Having the swim spa completely above ground is another option that allows you to fence only the steps (as long as the swim spa is over 1200mm high the height of pool fencing).</p>
<p>Swim spas offer impact-free exercise. The heat from the tub can cause blood to circulate abnormally for children and will then cause heat stroke. If you want to have friends over for parties this summer, then this hot tub, despite its size, is still simple to inflate and deflate as and when you need to, but remember it will require a lot more water than the smaller models. Ideally, swim spa workouts are combined with a basic land based exercise program” for optimal results.</p>
<p>A pool spa is used for people who have plenty of room in their yard and who want the best of both worlds for their swimming and relaxation pleasure. If you don't have kids or plan to only use your spa for swimming and exercise, a one tank spa might work out better. All Vortex Swim Spas are big enough for inflatable toys right up to a floating lounger. This company has five lines of swim spas: AquaPlay, AquaTrainer, ExecutiveTrainer, AquaSport and ExecutiveSport.</p>

<p>Of course, we also looked at the swim spa systems each company offers. Spa (also hot tub): Unlike swim spas, these are made for relaxation. The Hydrozone Pro has two powerful swim jets and three pumps, while the Pro Plus has three swim jets and four pumps and the Hydrozone Extreme is the ultimate with four powerful swim jets and five pumps. Three primary actions are important for maintaining the water in your Hot Tub in tip-top shape.</p>
<p>Finally, if you live in an area, which has hard water, then you will need to add an anti-scaling chemical to stop the build-up of calcium deposits on the sides and floor of your hot tub. The powerful jets enable you to swim in place just as you would in a regular pool or in the lake. Designed to improve your lifestyle and offer a better way of taking care of yourself, Jacuzzi® hot tubs are the most complete and versatile synthesis of shared well-being.</p>
