<p>How to design for a Jacuzzi in your house. The Hydrozone Plunge has no swim jets and two pumps. Our decision was based on expert knowledge, common sense advice regarding running costs, information about water cleanliness and about the necessary foundations for the product, delivery and set up and of course on the significant therapeutic benefits the spa will offer to my husband. Arctic Spas® has solutions for these valid concerns with our FreeHeat and Spa Boy® technology greatly lowering your monthly energy costs and to help maintain ideal spa conditions.</p>
<p>It's an inflatable jacuzzi so you can still get a good deal on it, and it holds up to six people and more water than most: up to 290Gal (1097L).

Each hot tub is master crafted to achieve enhanced, innovative therapy and high tech advancements in construction, performance, insulation, filtration and heating systems.</p>
<p>Jets and waterfalls are also features that can come with the hot tub to add to the relaxing benefits and ambiance.

Thankfully, chemicals in a whirlpool bath can kill sperm quickly, and a woman who is simply sitting in the water isn't in an active, "open" position that would allow sperm to enter.</p>
