<p>Hot Tubs Rock is a local and independently owned company based in Magor, South Wales. On the other end, a pair of powerful swim jets produce one of the smoothest swim currents in the industry, fully adjustable for any level swimmer, with a backlit buoyancy jet that illuminates the swim current and combines the perfect amount of air to elevate the swimmer into the ideal position. Our collection of swim and fitness spas are the pinnacle of performance and style providing improved wellness and a better quality of life conveniently at home.</p>
<p>The drastic price difference while having the same benefits give swim spas an advantage over the other options. There are Hot tub on the marketplace now that are designed for two people only; therefore the tubs are much smaller to the traditional larger hot tubs. These smaller sized swim spas can still accommodate several bathers, although if you're taller than average it might feel a little small. Another great characteristic that comes with owning a swim spa is that its maintenance is so much easier then it would be with owning a swimming pool.</p>
<p>The idea is that you swim in the tub and the current produced by the swim spa pushes against you in much the same way as a treadmill. Putting one on the second floor is not a good idea, unless it is a small bathtub Jacuzzi. Our insulation system harnesses all the heat from the pumps and the heater inside the spa cabinet while reflecting the colder outside air away from the spa. This is why we make Royal Spa Swim Spas from components that can be found at most pool and spa supply stores.</p>

<p>The risks involved highlight the importance of using the correct chemical products for your pool and swim spa. Gone are the days where hot tubs are placed in one spot and stay there indefinitely. You should also remove and clean the Hot Tubs filter thoroughly making sure you remove any contamination. The majority of spa pools contain LED lighting or another kind built-in with various color options. Aquatic Circuit Training in a swimspa increases your aerobic and strength levels and burns more calories than other forms of exercise.</p>

Swim spas are only unhealthy if you don't look after them properly. There are so many benefits to owning a swim spa and by following the above seven tips you can be sure to find the best swim spa for your family and needs. One major thing to remember and definitely not overlook is how much space you have to fit your hot tub into.</p>

Some swimming pool cleaning services experts recommend reducing pump operation to one hour per day until normal filtration cycle time is reached.

With multiple pumps you also get more and stronger massage jets as you can divert the water from the swim jets to the massage seats when you are not swimming.</p>

The food coloring will not damage any of the components in your hot tub, but you will have to drain it afterwards and refill it with fresh water.

There is a new invention called a Fast Lane Swim Jet unit that can be been retrofitted into most existing swimming pools.</p>

These are common pressure areas and jetted bathtubs know how to attack what ails you.</p>
