<p>Hot tubs are a great way to relax after a long day at work. If you want an inground swim spa installed, you can expect to pay more than these prices, as there is so much extra work involved in installing any pool inground.

Quarrycast is a mineral crystal composite, a new material developed by Victoria & Albert Baths, to enhance your bathing experience: it's warm to the touch, keeping the water in your hot tub hot for a long time; it has a naturally high gloss finish and it can be colored with the dye of your choice, maximizing the interior design options in your bathroom.</p>
