You are probably thinking, Yeah, this sounds great, but it probably costs like a trillion dollars.” That is a common misconception about Swim Spas…that they are only for the fabulously wealthy. Illumatherapy also offers four points of entry, with two on each side of the tub, and air bubbles spraying from the jets give the appearance of dancing as they reflect the light. The blowers make the hot tub feel like you've got your own personal geyser - forcing air from the bottom of the pool, and creating a very relaxing environment for you.</p>

Design, Wellbeing, Performance and Care: these are the values that constituted the essence of Jacuzzi®, a brand that anticipates needs and trends, creating innovative products and solutions designed to meet requests of any kind. The best way to find a genuine and reliable hot tub dealer is to see if they are part of BISHTA (British and Irish Spa and Hot Tub Association), this is a hot tub association that makes sure all hot tub dealers are keeping to the correct laws and make sure they are providing customers with safe information as well as good service to their customers.</p>
