<p>In 1956 the Jacuzzi brothers invented the original hydrotherapy jet, today with 60 years' experience in hydrotherapy: Jacuzzi® is the brand when you are looking for a hot tub or bathroom products. They utilize the highest quality parts and design to deliver a stronger, wider and smoother swimming experience then other swim spas can. Today, we can derive the benefits of saunas in terms of weight loss, cardiovascular health, treatment of many skin disorders and beauty needs, immune system boosting and as adjunctive therapy to treatment of a number of other disorders. This one is the largest of all the tubs on our list, seating up to 8 people and this time customers say it's true to size.</p>
<p>As its name suggests, a swim spa pool is basically a cross between a spa and a swimming pool. But even with limited space, a larger swim spa is still much smaller than a full pool while providing a comfortable experience for a decent number of people. When most people go to buy the spas, the first question they have in mind is the cost and the second question is about the power consumption. Swim Spas actually cost a bit more than a portable hot tub spa and a lot less than an inground swimming pool.</p>
<p>You can have self-contained and portable” unit, you can just get a Swim Spa shell and set it into a deck, you can have a customized Swim spa made for you or you can get a Swim Spa Water Jet and install it into your existing above ground or inground swimming pool. While their selection may appear limited compared to our picks for the best walk-in tub brands , it's easier to narrow down your choices from a few solid American-made tubs with various therapeutic benefits.</p>
