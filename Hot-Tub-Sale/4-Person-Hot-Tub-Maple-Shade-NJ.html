Many people do not realize how dangerous it can be to ignore this crucial swimming gear. Even if you don't have a regular recreational pool, make sure there isn't anything enticing left around your swim spa or hot tub. The best thing about a Swim Spa is that it eliminates the need for a full-sized swimming pool and a spa and thus cuts back on the amount of space needed.</p>
<h3>Hot Tub Spa Review Maple Shade</h3>
<p>This area generally doesn't hold more than one or two people at a time, and its jets mimic those found in traditional hot tubs. Jacuzzi spas' plumbing components are warranted against leaks due to defects in workmanship or materials for five years.

<p>Additionally, these swim spas are extremely relaxing and induce hydrotherapy with massaging jets and contour seating. If you want to heat your swim spa at all you need to consider buying a dual zone swim spa so you can use the electric heater(s) to affordably heat just the spa end only and take the edge off” the temperature in the swim end. This is due to the types of pumps, swim jets and plumbing used by many brands and the fact that they do not understand the technology involved.</p>
