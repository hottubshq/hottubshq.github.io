<p>Hot tubs and spas are becoming increasingly more popular and they are to be found in many homes. According to Wikipedia : a Hot Tub is a large tub or small pool full of heated water and used for hydrotherapy or pleasure. Add warmth and water movement and hot tubbing becomes the stuff of lifetime memories. If you do use a hot tub, turn down the temperature and limit your time in the water to less than 10 minutes. A Spa system will use air to push the water around your bath and create that bubble and whirl effects.</p>
<p>2. 24 hour circulation pumps-These pumps function by using a small pump to force water through the heating and filtration system.

Most people are not duly trained in installing whirlpool tubs so it is strongly advised to hire a contractor for installation.</p>

The hot moving water in the Jacuzzi soothes your muscles. This jet driven swim spa is one of the largest and most powerful on the market while providing the space and functionality for an entire family. It is a whole lot easier to climb into a hot tub than it is to pull yourself out over the slippery water filled sides so that cover will help prevent any sort of accident if you leave it open and unattended.</p>
<p>The Hydrozone Plunge has no swim jets and two pumps. Our decision was based on expert knowledge, common sense advice regarding running costs, information about water cleanliness and about the necessary foundations for the product, delivery and set up and of course on the significant therapeutic benefits the spa will offer to my husband. Arctic Spas® has solutions for these valid concerns with our FreeHeat and Spa Boy® technology greatly lowering your monthly energy costs and to help maintain ideal spa conditions.</p>

<p>Since a whirl pool is a place where people spend a considerable amount of time inside, it should have good wide panoramic views so as to avoid monotony and boredom. Swim spas offer all the comfort and benefits of hot tubs, but they come in a larger size, almost like a small swimming pool. Start by thinking about how you plan to use the swim spa — therapy, relaxation, exercise or all of the above. The Jacuzzi water heater model is the king of them all.</p>
