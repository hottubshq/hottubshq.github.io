<p>Hot tubs have been around since ancient Roman and Greek cultures and in Japan from ancient times right through to today.

TAKE YOUR HOT TUBBING SWIM SPA EXPERIENCE TO THE NEXT LEVEL WITH BATHLINE SENSATIONS SWIM SPA.</p>
<p>In 1956, the Jacuzzi family created a portable hydrotherapy pump to help treat a family member's painful arthritis. This creates a stronger massage than tubs with the air jets. Equipped with classic filtration systems and just one or two pumps depending on the model, these J-200 Jacuzzi® hot tubs are among Jacuzzi's most affordable models. Swim spas are flexible, durable and practical. In just a few years' time, Jacuzzi became a household name and was quickly used to refer to any and all hot tubs, however incorrectly.</p>

<p>Made with high tech rolling technology, this energy efficient cover is extremely easy to operate and it makes taking on and off your swim spa cover easier than ever. Natural swimming pools attempt to duplicate the environment of natural swimmable lakes which are healthy, non-polluted and ecologically-balanced bodies of water. Nowadays, the one-piece hot tubs are also quite common and have many advantages as well.</p>
<p>Hot water is a great way to keep the body moving. A Jacuzzi soaking tub is the most common type of tub, and this basic concept is Jacuzzi's foundation for hydrotherapy tubs. Some hot tubs also come with features that Jacuzzi products do not, such as flat-screen TVs and built-in MP3 audio systems. Our Swim Spa River Jets are each powered solely by a 4 HP (6BHP) Hyper Flow Jet Pump. Having the swim spa completely above ground is another option that allows you to fence only the steps (as long as the swim spa is over 1200mm high the height of pool fencing).</p>

We recommend that you consult a plumber to calculate precisely what size water heater you'll need for a walk-in tub so you won't shortchange the rest of your household while bathing.</p>
