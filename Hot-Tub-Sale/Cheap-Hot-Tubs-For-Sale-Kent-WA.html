<p>OK, class ~ it's time to define the true meaning of the different types of hot water therapy. It has the new River Jet swim system with Viper pumps, and plenty of water features. Whisper-quiet motors, colorful lighting, dancing air bubbles, powerful jets — your bath is an expression of yourself and an extension of how you want to feel. Most indoor kinds hold one or two people simply because the available space is limited to the standard size bathroom. Similar to a regular bathtub you would see in a home, these hot tubs, sometimes called whirlpool baths or Jacuzzis, are filled with water for each use than drained when your soaking is complete.</p>
<p>In 1956, the Jacuzzi family created a portable hydrotherapy pump to help treat a family member's painful arthritis. This creates a stronger massage than tubs with the air jets. Equipped with classic filtration systems and just one or two pumps depending on the model, these J-200 Jacuzzi® hot tubs are among Jacuzzi's most affordable models. Swim spas are flexible, durable and practical. In just a few years' time, Jacuzzi became a household name and was quickly used to refer to any and all hot tubs, however incorrectly.</p>
<p>All of a sudden, you could produce a 14′ to 18′ long Swim Spa and offer it for sale anywhere between $13,000 - $25,000 complete, delivered, hooked up and installed and ready for use in a few hours. Modern tubs also usually include hydrotherapy jets, making it possible to have a nice relaxing massage while soaking in the hot tub. They are a combination of swimming pools and tubs. Also check out our JACUZZI® financing options so you can rest easy in your tub without worrying about your bank account.</p>
