<p>In our modern, high-tech society, everything gets reviewed these days. As you are swimming in the sea you should not try to work harder than you would in a regular pool. Hot tubs are usually located outdoors, although they can be installed indoors. This is a patented technology; hence, you will not find this technology in any other ordinary swim spas. Using heat and the element of massage, Healthy Living Hot Tubs create one-of-a-kind hydrotherapy to ease aches and pain, calm stress and boost the natural healing response.</p>

<p>For example, people with multiple sclerosis should avoid a swim spa because warm water can exacerbate symptoms, while people with arthritis tend to prefer a pool that is around 90 degrees Fahrenheit.

Funny you should ask, because we happen to have a video that produced in 2008 at the Artesian Spas factory in Las Vegas, NV. The video is actually called "How Do They Build A Hot Tub Spa?", but the model that they are building in the video happens to be a large 16' Swim Spa. Unless you've specifically added additional coverage for your hot tub, any damages to it may not be covered by your regular policy.</p>
<p>2nd Day Air Shipping not available for chemicals, spas, and other items that normally ship by freight. 1. choose pumps with single speed jet and circulation, 2. Always enquire about the noise of the pump, 3. Don't concern yourself with horsepower ratings, turn your attention to other more valuable components such as the spas jets or filtration systems. Since hot tubs have been around for years, and the first fiberglass, vacuformed acrylic spas were made in 1982, look for a hot tub dealer that's been in the business for a long time, and you probably can't go wrong.</p>

If you plan to heat your swim spa regularly, especially the swim end due to the large amount of water, you need to be able to use a gas or a heat pump as the electric heaters will be very expensive.</p>
