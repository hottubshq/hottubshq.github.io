Hot tubs are usually located outdoors, although they can be installed indoors. This is a patented technology; hence, you will not find this technology in any other ordinary swim spas. Using heat and the element of massage, Healthy Living Hot Tubs create one-of-a-kind hydrotherapy to ease aches and pain, calm stress and boost the natural healing response.</p>

<p>You can still by spas and hot tubs under the Jacuzzi name. For example, a 60-gallon tub would require a 40-gallon water heater.
