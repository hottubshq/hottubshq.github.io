<p>We all know the benefits of owning a swimming pool. Browse other J-300 models to experience additional spas with more jets or smaller tubs. Some swim spas, which are usually small in size, are not heated as much as hot tubs. From the perfect placement of PowerPro® Jets to the optimal positioning of the body in ergonomic seats, a Jacuzzi® Hot Tub delivers the ultimate hydrotherapy massage. Shopping for a hot tub or sauna can be a daunting task — especially if you haven't shopped for one before.</p>
<p>In 1956, the Jacuzzi family created a portable hydrotherapy pump to help treat a family member's painful arthritis. This creates a stronger massage than tubs with the air jets. Equipped with classic filtration systems and just one or two pumps depending on the model, these J-200 Jacuzzi® hot tubs are among Jacuzzi's most affordable models. Swim spas are flexible, durable and practical. In just a few years' time, Jacuzzi became a household name and was quickly used to refer to any and all hot tubs, however incorrectly.</p>
<p>Relaxing in a warm jetted hot tub is very relaxing and good for your mental health. Ensure you have plenty of space to fit the hot tub, as well as easy access to the power source and enough room to safely get in and out of the hot tub. Hydropool has swim spas for relaxing, working out and even a little bit of both. Vortex Spas feature advanced water treatment technologies that work together in tandem with a light chemical boost to keep your water crystal clear and healthy.</p>

Through the late 80's and the 90's I continued selling and installing primarily inground, or built in” swim spas. Old fashioned hot tub manufacturers and indeed those hot tubs that are not made to the very latest designs and standards use linked, jet-to-jet plumbing systems which can often result in the very first jet in the line being very powerful and the last jet being much less so.</p>

<p>The modular design also allows for pools of varying sizes from 7' x 12' to 10' x 16' with water depths up to 6' deep.

<p>This is also how hot tubs take away stress. Hot tubs are unlike saunas, steam- and Turkish baths, which are steam only. You can easily assemble a swim spa together and use it as a portable swimming pool, wherever you go. Positioned to hit your shoulders and torso (jets that are too far apart or too low will not create the required resistance against the body and are a waste of water flow). Spas should also have a diverter valve to maintain water pressure on 1 or 2 seats.</p>

<p>If you are planning to heat your swim spa for some or all of the year the best way to do this is with a heat pump which can heat (and potentially cool) your spa - providing total control over the water temperature for under $10 a week. It's important to note that some insurance providers simply won't cover you with the additional risk that a hot tub introduces. We recommend that you consult a plumber to calculate precisely what size water heater you'll need for a walk-in tub so you won't shortchange the rest of your household while bathing.</p>
