<p>Now, this was fine for a number of years until, of course, spas started springing up in hotels and sports complexes and going to the spa” (yah!) just like the Romans did became cool again. Go for a more powerful spa pump if you have a bigger jacuzzi or the pressure of water in your area is relatively lower.
