<p>Swim spas and spa pools (also known as portable spas or hot tubs) are very similar. We only needed ten shifts in the water (two of our teammates only had to swim once), which I thought was pretty impressive for a group of mostly-first timers. It was basic and even rudimentary, but from that moment on I have been obsessed with swim spas. The reason is air capacity is cut by approximately 75% during water exercise because of the water's pressure on your body.</p>
<p>Your swim spa should be heat pump ready” and you should try and buy a swim spa with a heat pump compatible controller. In a Swim Spa, you are swimming in place as water rushes past you causing a loss of buoyancy that would be normally produced as you pull yourself up and over static water with every stroke. This then pairs with a bigger pump which is in charge of fueling the spas jets. They then managed to create a swimming spa which is more convenient to use compared to outdoor activities.</p>
