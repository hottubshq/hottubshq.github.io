Many have what is known as thermal” spa facilities which basically means that there will be hydrotherapy pools, possibly steam rooms, ice caves, salt steam rooms, feature showers and maybe saunas at different temperatures. However, larger swim spas have dual-zone” heating; the primary section for the workouts is cold, while the second one for relaxing is hot.
