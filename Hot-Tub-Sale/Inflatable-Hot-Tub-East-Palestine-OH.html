<p>Hydrotherapy and Jacuzzi hot tubs seem to go hand and hand these days. The Endless Pools Fitness Systems shell has a modern style with clean lines that flow gracefully from end to end. Built from the highest quality acrylic, Endless Pools swim spas are designed to provide years of family fun and enjoyment. The Jacuzzi brother's patent ran out 10 years later in 1976 which lead to the American hot tub market taking off as they were able to use the Jacuzzi type jets. The original hydrotherapy jet was invented by the Jacuzzi® brothers in 1956.</p>
<p>The difference with swim spas is that they're often larger than a standard spa pool and have an open area at one end without seating. If an Extreme Lighting Package is installed on your spa, each corner will light up to match the color of light in your hot tub. When you allow the massaging jets to massage your sore spots or even just hold your feet up to the circulating massaging water you will immediately feel better and your feet won't hurt much at all.</p>
<p>Jacuzzi® baths and showers are shipped from Georgia for delivery across North America. We also share your personal data with other companies within the ThermoSpas family for marketing and sales purposes. Once the art of staying afloat is mastered the swimmer can enjoy the feeling of being in the water, while the body's buoyancy means there is far less stress on the body that exercises such as running. You can use bubble bath and bath salts in this type of jetted bathtub.</p>

<p>The hot water afterward will release the tension in your muscles from your workouts which gives you the perfect combination for a better environment to increase your exercise quality. We are your spa, hot tub and swim spa specialist. If you're looking for more of a massage to the muscles, then a whirlpool system is a better choice. Any requests for change of site location must first be approved in writing by Clearwater Spas.</p>
<p>However, you can turn the jets off and just soak, and many swim spas have an area designed just for that - essentially, there is a hot tub area in your spa. It also allows you to use your heat pump to cool the water in summer which is a very valuable benefit. Come and visit our showrooms where you can see our huge range of quality Spas and Swim Spas.

<p>In 1956, the Jacuzzi family created a portable hydrotherapy pump to help treat a family member's painful arthritis. This creates a stronger massage than tubs with the air jets. Equipped with classic filtration systems and just one or two pumps depending on the model, these J-200 Jacuzzi® hot tubs are among Jacuzzi's most affordable models. Swim spas are flexible, durable and practical. In just a few years' time, Jacuzzi became a household name and was quickly used to refer to any and all hot tubs, however incorrectly.</p>
