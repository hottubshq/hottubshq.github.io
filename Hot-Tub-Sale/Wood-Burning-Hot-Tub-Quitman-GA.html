If space is no problem, you may want to consider a larger unit like the one to the left (16' or larger) that has two separate sections molded into it. Realize that these style units may be a bit more costly because they need two completely separate filtering, pumping and heating systems.</p>
<p>Although the larger Jacuzzi family thought this idea was a little weird, the sales grew and soon the bathtub was designed to be a bit larger so as to fit in 2 people. In Jacuzzi an electric heater can be installed to enjoy hot whirling water. Residential or home pools are sometimes built-in or assembled above ground. Many dealerships now display Swim Spas in their stores. We design and manufacture our own hot tubs for public and private use, for indoor or outdoor installation, for frequent or occasional use and for relaxing or to supplement your fitness regime.</p>
<p>This is a very popular option for people who have small water heaters or wish to install an outdoor Jacuzzi Instead of completely draining your household water heater to fill up the Jacuzzi tub, you can use cooler water and let the independent heating system kick in.
