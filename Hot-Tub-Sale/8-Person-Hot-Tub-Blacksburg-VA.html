<p>Bacteria like a warm moist environment to grow in. You need to make sure they don't get it. If you wear a swimsuit in the hot tub, take it off immediately when you get out. Hot tubs can rightly be considered spa treatments on a domestic scale, an ideal solution when the limited or inadequate space, or technical impediments, do not allow to have a normal size swimming pool. The Bellavista collection comes in your choice of rectangular and triangular shapes, and is available in all four of Jacuzzi's luxury tub experiences: Soaking Bath, Pure Air, Whirlpool, and Salon Spa.</p>
<p>Indoor tubs may produce some moisture when in use, particularly if the ambient room temperature is much less than the water inside the vessel (hot tub water temperatures range from 100-104 degrees F).
