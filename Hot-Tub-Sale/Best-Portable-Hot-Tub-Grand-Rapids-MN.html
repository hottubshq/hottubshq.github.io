<p>A guy named Dr. Stephen Blair (University of South Carolina) conducted an extended survey to study the effectiveness of swimming for fitness. All swim spa covers are made specifically to fit your Master Spas swim spa and come 6" thick in the middle and taper off to 4". This cover includes an energy efficient 1.5 lb foam density and a 24 R-value, with a full length heat seal and upgraded rubber grip handles (included!). We had limited space and the swim spa allowed us to maximise the use of our garden and has proven to be far more economical than a pool.</p>
<p>Some models use an air blower to force air through a separate set of jets for a different "bubbly" massage effect; this is a separate system from the induced air. Whether your choice of exercise is running, walking, jogging, or working out at the gym, the fitness of hot tubs and spas are just what you need for those tired, aching muscles at affordable prices. This process is particularly crucial for spas which are manufactured in extreme weather environments e.g., very hot, very cold or humid conditions.</p>
<p>The jet system commonly installed in a whirlpool tub, hot tub, or outdoor spa provides a massaging motion that targets the muscle groups in the body. Hot tub pump replacements, parts, impellers, wet ends and seals can be ordered online with quick shipping in order to complete a repair and get the spa working properly again. Swim spas with poor purification systems will require extra money (and time) spent on chemicals.</p>

<p>Saunas induce sweating, which causes a decrease in the body's toxic load and thereby promotes better health. Next, it is important that you check the pH balance of the water in your jacuzzi style hot tub on a regular basis. Some of these are heated in the traditional way with wood fires and there are some companies that rent them out and run experience days where you can use traditional hot tubs in the peace and tranquillity of unspoilt woodland and other open spaces.</p>
<p>In the pool most people simply swim lengths and you can choose whether to swim for a set amount of time, or a number of lengths. Hot tubs must always ALWAYS be kept clean. Sitting in a sauna bath increases skin temperature, causes the pulse rate to double, and thus, increases blood circulation. Today, Jacuzzi features an expanded luxury tub environment, with four types of therapeutic tubs. Our hot tubs are extremely durable, but should anything go wrong, you won't be left high and dry.</p>
<p>You are probably thinking, Yeah, this sounds great, but it probably costs like a trillion dollars.” That is a common misconception about Swim Spas…that they are only for the fabulously wealthy. Illumatherapy also offers four points of entry, with two on each side of the tub, and air bubbles spraying from the jets give the appearance of dancing as they reflect the light. The blowers make the hot tub feel like you've got your own personal geyser - forcing air from the bottom of the pool, and creating a very relaxing environment for you.</p>
