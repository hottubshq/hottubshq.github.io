Our innovative use of LED has changed the way spa pools are being lit. You certainly can relax more effectively in your hot tub when you keep those custom spa covers in place when you are not actively using your spa or hot tub.

Undoubtedly, the inclusion of a whirlpool tub in your bathroom is a huge selling point that can dramatically increase the return on your upgrade.</p>
<p>Instead of forking out more than $70k on a pool, many resorts to owning a spa swim that started with $14k. Swim spas can be used for many types of exercise, beyond the invigorating workouts you get swimming against the resistance current. In contrast to a typical bathtub , a hot tub is designed to be used by more than one person at a time, with many models accommodating four or more people. There are many companies that carry jetted tubs, some of the most well known include American Standard and Whirlpool bathtubs.</p>
