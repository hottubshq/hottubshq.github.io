<h3>Why Choose Swim Spas Over Hot Tubs Fort Thomas</h3>
<p>Look for insulated swim spas such as fiberglass units constructed with a wood core. Instead, it's niche hot tub companies like Canadian Spa, Bestway, Coleman and Essential that offer a variety of great pop-up and full-sized tub choices. We have made it our goal to be the best manufacturer of hot tubs and swim spas in the world. SwimCross Exercise Systems introduces a jetted swim option with exceptional value, from the makers of Endless Pools.</p>
<p>The reason most people opt for a swim spa is that they don't have enough room for a full-sized swimming pool. The swimming part of a swim spa is what makes it uniquely different than a hot tub alone, however. Always make certain the spa's control system accommodates the heat pump. And if you're interested in swimming laps without installing a massive pool, swim spas are a great alternative. As we evaluated them, we considered their current systems and the types of jets they offer as well as their customer service, selection, prices and accessories.</p>
