The design features five jets - three on top for resistance and two underneath for lift - that create a smooth, air-free current for superior low-impact, total-body exercise. Look for a swim spa that insulates both the water in the swim spa and the outer cabinet.</p>
<p>Our new jetted swim current lets you exercise with gentle resistance, and then unwind in ergonomically sculpted hydromassage seats. The photo to the left shows the hot tub spa area of an all-in-one Swim Spa unit. You don't need to have the jets or blowers on - there is nothing like laying in your own hot tub, with just your head poking out of the water, watching the sun go down. With a swim spa at home, the incredible benefits of aquatic fitness are delivered right to your doorstep—no traveling, monthly gym membership or navigating a crowded pool filled with strangers.</p>
