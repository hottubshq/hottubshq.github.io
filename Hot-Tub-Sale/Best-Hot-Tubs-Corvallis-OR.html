<p>Riptide swim spas and exercise pools delivered and installed by our experienced team. Hot water is a great way to keep the body moving. A Jacuzzi soaking tub is the most common type of tub, and this basic concept is Jacuzzi's foundation for hydrotherapy tubs. Some hot tubs also come with features that Jacuzzi products do not, such as flat-screen TVs and built-in MP3 audio systems. Our Swim Spa River Jets are each powered solely by a 4 HP (6BHP) Hyper Flow Jet Pump. Having the swim spa completely above ground is another option that allows you to fence only the steps (as long as the swim spa is over 1200mm high the height of pool fencing).</p>
<p>In 1956, the Jacuzzi family created a portable hydrotherapy pump to help treat a family member's painful arthritis. This creates a stronger massage than tubs with the air jets. Equipped with classic filtration systems and just one or two pumps depending on the model, these J-200 Jacuzzi® hot tubs are among Jacuzzi's most affordable models. Swim spas are flexible, durable and practical. In just a few years' time, Jacuzzi became a household name and was quickly used to refer to any and all hot tubs, however incorrectly.</p>

This Jacuzzi bathtub is the easiest way of bringing lavishness and grace with elegance to your lifestyle. This is a self-contained Swim Spa that has been set on the ground and then had a wood deck built around it. Notice that the body of water is all together (not separated into two areas).</p>

<p>With regular workouts lasting a reasonable amount of time (no, five minutes is not going to cut it), the body's compensation for the lack of lung capacity underwater will in turn increase capacity on dry land. While typically installed on a patio, an Endless Pools Swim Spa can be installed indoors in a converted garage or with new construction. Onsens: using a hot spring as the source of hot water an Onsen is a public or private communal bathing house.</p>
<p>Modern Hot Tubs will use a manifold plumbing system in order to ensure efficiency in the plumbing and this helps keep the operating noise to a minimum.

Programmable sleep timers - This function gives you the control to turn your spa off completely for the duration of the night, avoiding any sleep disturbances for family or neighbors.</p>
<p>Your swim spa should be heat pump ready” and you should try and buy a swim spa with a heat pump compatible controller. In a Swim Spa, you are swimming in place as water rushes past you causing a loss of buoyancy that would be normally produced as you pull yourself up and over static water with every stroke. This then pairs with a bigger pump which is in charge of fueling the spas jets. They then managed to create a swimming spa which is more convenient to use compared to outdoor activities.</p>
