<p>Spas and Hot tubs have enjoyed huge popularity of the last few years. This is a spa that is offered at a fitness club or a recreational club as an added facility. Unlike a swimming pool which can be quite costly to install and requires a large backyard, swim spas offer this all-in-one portable package in a box that can be craned into position in an hour. If you plan to heat your swim spa regularly, especially the swim end due to the large amount of water, you need to be able to use a gas or a heat pump as the electric heaters will be very expensive.</p>
<p>In case you need something much bigger, SwimEx makes the 1000 S - a multi-user swim spa that holds 7,700 gallons of water. Besides the usual Jacuzzi jets of water, the entire pool looked like the wake of the QE2. If you are looking for the best quality hot tub for your family, Jacuzzi is the brand for you. In fact, Jacuzzi is a trademarked brand of hot tubs, bath products and pool equipment. Swimming is a well-known way to achieve weight loss, so with the right training regime, a swim spa should definitely be able to help you if you're looking to get slimmer.</p>
<p>The latest hot tubs have superior ozone systems resulting in the use of much less chemicals. This open-concept tank is large enough to offer many of the benefits that swimming pools do. Often, companies that offer swimming pool cleaning services recommend lowering the water level for winterizing. Key questions to answer when shopping for a hot tub are how many people will be using it at one time, and where you plan to place your hot tub.</p>

All Endless Pools® Fitness Systems and SwimCross Exercise Systems feature a durable, two millimetre galvanised steel frame and ABS base pan which together provide superior support and protection from ground contact.</p>
<p>Imagine the luxury of being able to swim laps from your very own swimming pool at home. If the Paris hot tub is just a tad out of your price range, then you can still reap all the benefits of a Lay-Z-Spa with the Miami hot tub. Hot tubs are sometimes also known as spas, or by the trade name Jacuzzi. Some Swim Spa units are separated into two distinct bodies of water. Weight loss spas, swim spas or beauty spas indulge and pamper yourself all the way to the glory.</p>

In Jacuzzi an electric heater can be installed to enjoy hot whirling water. Residential or home pools are sometimes built-in or assembled above ground. Many dealerships now display Swim Spas in their stores. We design and manufacture our own hot tubs for public and private use, for indoor or outdoor installation, for frequent or occasional use and for relaxing or to supplement your fitness regime.</p>
<p>However, you can turn the jets off and just soak, and many swim spas have an area designed just for that - essentially, there is a hot tub area in your spa. It also allows you to use your heat pump to cool the water in summer which is a very valuable benefit. Come and visit our showrooms where you can see our huge range of quality Spas and Swim Spas.

Without the correct contact time, clarifying will not be successful and elements within the spa such as the jets, headrests and covers can become damaged.
