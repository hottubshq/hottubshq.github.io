<p>They find SwimLife swimspas the ultimate answer to satify all their needs and answer the demand for more for their money. SwimLife is all about changing how the industry sells and promotes swimspas. A sauna bath feels therapeutic, but may be a bit too warm for the testicles, and men who regularly spend time in hot tubs may have low fertility rates as a result. Cheaper spas sometimes reduce the size of the unit to make up for these cuts.</p>

<p>However, you can turn the jets off and just soak, and many swim spas have an area designed just for that - essentially, there is a hot tub area in your spa. It also allows you to use your heat pump to cool the water in summer which is a very valuable benefit. Come and visit our showrooms where you can see our huge range of quality Spas and Swim Spas. If you are unsure as to whether a swim spa or plunge pool would be more applicable to your home or backyard layout and size, speak with our team and allow them to offer their expertise and talk you through our costs and affordable prices.</p>
<p>Your swim spa should be heat pump ready” and you should try and buy a swim spa with a heat pump compatible controller. In a Swim Spa, you are swimming in place as water rushes past you causing a loss of buoyancy that would be normally produced as you pull yourself up and over static water with every stroke. This then pairs with a bigger pump which is in charge of fueling the spas jets. They then managed to create a swimming spa which is more convenient to use compared to outdoor activities.</p>
