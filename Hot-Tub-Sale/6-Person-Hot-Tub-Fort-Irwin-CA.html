<p>When considering which model or Spa brand to buy the question has to be asked is it true that the number of Jets in a Hot Tub really matter or is it a question of how these Jets are designed to produce that ever so nice hydro massage effect that everybody enjoys so much. Traditionally the water in a hot tub is still, just like a swimming pool, and would only be circulated to heat filter it. Chlorine and disinfectants are used to maintain the hot tub. Pumps - Various pumps are used perhaps a separate circulation pump depending on the design of the Jacuzzi Hot Tub. To use vinegar to clean a hot tub, simply pour a one gallon jug of white vinegar into the tub and turn on the jets through one cycle.</p>
