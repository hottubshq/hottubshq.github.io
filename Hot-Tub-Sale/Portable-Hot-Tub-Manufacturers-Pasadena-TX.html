The 8' x 17' cover (94" x 201") Master Spas® swim spa replacement cover is a Master Spa Factory OEM replacement part. This is where a swim spa can be the perfect solution; it takes up little space, is much less expensive than a pool, can provide the privacy you want, and is convenient, making exercise more likely.</p>
<p>Change body positions to target different muscle groups for horizontal swimming, upright aerobic fitness and seated strength conditioning. Jacuzzi manufacturers their tubs in Valdosta, Georgia so you know your tub will meet U.S. standards and license requirements.

<p>This pool's small size means less water and less water means smaller heating costs and fewer chemicals - a savings on both time and money. Through the late 80's and the 90's I continued selling and installing primarily inground, or built in” swim spas. Old fashioned hot tub manufacturers and indeed those hot tubs that are not made to the very latest designs and standards use linked, jet-to-jet plumbing systems which can often result in the very first jet in the line being very powerful and the last jet being much less so.</p>

Also, pull up or remove ladders from above-ground models when not in use to prevent children from climbing into the pool or hot tub. An H2X Fitness Swim Spa allows you to exercise, relax, and entertain in the convenience and privacy of your backyard, year-round.</p>
