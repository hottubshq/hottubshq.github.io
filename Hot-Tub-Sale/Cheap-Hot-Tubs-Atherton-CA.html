<p>Hydrotherapy and Jacuzzi hot tubs seem to go hand and hand these days. The Endless Pools Fitness Systems shell has a modern style with clean lines that flow gracefully from end to end. Built from the highest quality acrylic, Endless Pools swim spas are designed to provide years of family fun and enjoyment. The Jacuzzi brother's patent ran out 10 years later in 1976 which lead to the American hot tub market taking off as they were able to use the Jacuzzi type jets. The original hydrotherapy jet was invented by the Jacuzzi® brothers in 1956.</p>
<p>The areas around the pump and tubes need clearance as well in case any repairs are needed down the line. If the pH level becomes too low, the water will become acidic, irritating the skin of swimmers and causing corrosive damage to your spa or pool. All Jacuzzi® Hot Tubs have a five stage filtration and ClearRay bulb, ensuring your water is quickly and easily cleared of all debris ready for use. In total, there are 14 swim spas to pick from - that's the largest selection of the companies we reviewed, matched only by Hydropool's inventory.</p>
<p>As Canada's largest hot tub company Arctic Spas® is committed to being a leader in pursuing tougher energy use legislation and will continue to drive the agenda of manufacturing responsible, safe and efficient products, and honesty in advertising. Kids love swimming under the twin laminar water feature jets. These jets actually push air into the tub instead of water causing a gentle massaging feeling. Our offered Modern Bath Tubis an integral part of places such as spas and other wellness centers.</p>

<h3>Hot Tub Therapy Atherton</h3>
<p>Of course, every Endless Pools Fitness System is so much more than a spa. Most of the hot tubs especially cheap imports from the east of the world are created using cheap methods, from people that probably have no expertise in the trade and are just following regular instructions from there team managers. Swimming pools make a great sand-less alternative, but laps in a public pool aren't always possible, and, of course, not private, and installing and maintaining your own pool may be too costly, not to mention the fact that you can't take it with you if you move or you may simply not have the space to accommodate one.</p>
<p>As swim spas are usually purchased by people with limited space, the average models are quite small compared to a full sized pool. Overall, considering the amount of features a swim spa has, it does offer good value, making it an attractive option, particularly if you are on a budget. Endless Pools is one of the first companies to develop this Swim Spa, or endless” swimming pool concept quite a number of years ago.</p>
<p>The company's history can be traced back to the mid-20th century when the Jacuzzi brothers invented an underwater pump that could be used to relieve pain in arthritis patients. Endless pool - swim spa promises a laminar current where you can even choose to have rowing equipment or an underwater treadmill to upgrade your normal swimming workouts The water carries most of your weight effortlessly for you to be able to perform any kind of exercises or workouts that you desire.</p>

Vortex swim spas come with a 5 year jet warranty. This is an infection of hair follicles; although it is most commonly caught from an unclean hot tub, it can also occur from an unclean swimming pool, using a loofah sponge that contains the bacteria or wearing a diving suit or swim clothes that are infected.</p>
<p>Swim Spas are smaller than typical swimming pools and this makes them much easier to drain for cleaning and maintenance. Between 2000 and 2014, outbreaks from treated pools and hot tubs were linked to more than 27,000 infections and eight deaths in the United States. They are often installed in houses as a replacement for a regular bathtub. Producing a steady, smooth current, single-shell models from Endless Pool Fitness Systems are perfect for those who enjoy total-body aquatic activity and complete relaxation.</p>
<p>This flexibility has allowed thousands of people to realize the dream of "endless" swimming at their own home. Quite simply, a Swim Spa is a machine that allows you to swim continuously against a water current. During the mid-2000's, a few keen hot tub manufacturers saw that there might be a larger market opening up in the Swim Spa industry, and a number of them changed their production lines to also produce the larger, more bulky Swim Spas.</p>
<p>The comfort features in a Jacuzzi walk-in tub enhance the benefits of passive heating. This is absolutely vital if the shell of the swim spa is to last the lifetime of ownership.
