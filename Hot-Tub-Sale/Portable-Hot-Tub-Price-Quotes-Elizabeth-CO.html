<h2>Hot Tubs And More Elizabeth Colorado</h2>
<p>Four pumps give this piece of equipment a lot of water flow, for therapy and exercise. Funny you should ask, because we happen to have a video that produced in 2008 at the Artesian Spas factory in Las Vegas, NV. The video is actually called "How Do They Build A Hot Tub Spa?", but the model that they are building in the video happens to be a large 16' Swim Spa. Unless you've specifically added additional coverage for your hot tub, any damages to it may not be covered by your regular policy.</p>
