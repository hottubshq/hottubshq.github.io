Endless Pools' swim spas create a current using a 16-inch propeller, and the current it makes is stronger than those created with jets.</p>

Also, the water in a hot tub is not changed with each use, but is kept sanitary using methods similar to those used for swimming pool sanitation citation needed Another difference between baths and hot tubs is that soaps and shampoos are not used in wet-jetted hot tubs (although they can be used in air-jetted hot tubs).</p>
