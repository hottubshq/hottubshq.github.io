<p>When you are looking for good swim spas, don't forget to have a look at the H2X. While budget swim spas promise a lesser financial burden initially, much more can go wrong if inferior materials and unskilled labor are used. In fact, some swim spas offer more versatility than large pools. In almost all cases the pumps and pipework are all contained under the bath so space shouldn't be a problem unless you're looking for a larger bath. Our friendly staff members are extremely knowledgeable about all variations of Australian swim spas, plunge pools and hot tubs for sale at competitive prices.</p>
<p>Take your soaking experience to the next level by adding Jacuzzi® Epsom Salt to your bathing ritual.

With multiple pumps you also get more and stronger massage jets as you can divert the water from the swim jets to the massage seats when you are not swimming.</p>
