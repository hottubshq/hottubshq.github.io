<p>Saunas have existed for thousands of years and are now being rediscovered the world over for their health and social benefits. First of all, Jacuzzi bathtubs are extremely expensive, costing anywhere from $600 to over $15,000 depending on the features they offer. All brands will have different features and components to make them different from other hot tub brands. Hot tubs can be installed in two different ways, either freestanding or inground. Our wider safety access steps and flat stepping areas at both the jet and seating end of the swimspas is functional and astietically pleasing.</p>
<p>Outdoor hot tubs also come in a variety of styles but are generally either a round or octagon shape. Most of these accidents happened at a pool or hot tub at the child's own home. At almost six metres in length and two and a half metres in width, the AquaSport 19 DTfX acts as a swimming pool, hot tub and aquafit centre all in a single unit. Unfortunately, there are a number of cons that come with having even a small Jacuzzi bathtub installed.</p>
<p>Instead of forking out more than $70k on a pool, many resorts to owning a spa swim that started with $14k. Swim spas can be used for many types of exercise, beyond the invigorating workouts you get swimming against the resistance current. In contrast to a typical bathtub , a hot tub is designed to be used by more than one person at a time, with many models accommodating four or more people. There are many companies that carry jetted tubs, some of the most well known include American Standard and Whirlpool bathtubs.</p>

Jacuzzi's Espree collection features curves specifically designed to contour around the body's natural curves. There's small hot tubs are ideal for people that wish to have a hot tub, but do not want a huge hot tub due to them not having room in the garden or just feel they do not have the need for a larger hot tub, as only every 2 people will be using the hot tub.</p>

<p>For this reason, it is now mandatory on public swimming pools in many states in the US. However, a swim spa can be a great addition to your backyard, as it offers the dual benefits of swimming and the spa experience on your own property.

The average swim spa weighs 3,000 pounds before adding a drop of water, and measures roughly 52 inches high.</p>
<p>With Jacuzzi for Life, you have the option of purchasing any 300, 400, 500 or LX series hot tub. Innovative jet pump & equipment technology and newer manufacturing methods made the cost of production of the Swim Spa to come down to the levels of a high quality portable hot tub.

Equipped with classic filtration systems and just one or two pumps depending on the model, these J-200 Jacuzzi® hot tubs are among Jacuzzi's most affordable models. Swim spas are flexible, durable and practical. In just a few years' time, Jacuzzi became a household name and was quickly used to refer to any and all hot tubs, however incorrectly.</p>
