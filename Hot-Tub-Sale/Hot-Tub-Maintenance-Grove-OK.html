<p>Even though swim spas are hugely beneficial from a health and wellness perspective, they suffer from one major drawback. As swim spas are usually purchased by people with limited space, the average models are quite small compared to a full sized pool. Overall, considering the amount of features a swim spa has, it does offer good value, making it an attractive option, particularly if you are on a budget.
