Hot tub folliculitis is a type of skin infection on the hair follicles which is brought about by immersion in a hot tub with unclean water.

The best swim spas are designed so you swim in place against a current, rather than swimming traditional lengths in a pool.</p>
<p>Since a whirl pool is a place where people spend a considerable amount of time inside, it should have good wide panoramic views so as to avoid monotony and boredom. Swim spas offer all the comfort and benefits of hot tubs, but they come in a larger size, almost like a small swimming pool. Start by thinking about how you plan to use the swim spa — therapy, relaxation, exercise or all of the above. The Jacuzzi water heater model is the king of them all.</p>
<p>The maintenance of the water in the hot tub water is the key of the routine daily maintenance activities. A tub full of hot water with jets that massage spells out supreme relaxation and luxury.
