<p>They find SwimLife swimspas the ultimate answer to satify all their needs and answer the demand for more for their money. SwimLife is all about changing how the industry sells and promotes swimspas.

Cheaper spas sometimes reduce the size of the unit to make up for these cuts.</p>
<p>The Jacuzzi Walk-In is designed to fit in the place of a standard bathtub, so it's the perfect choice for bathroom renovations as well as for replacing existing walk-in bathtubs. There is an inset within a wooden deck, so that it is easy to enter the hot tub. Some hot tubs need to be installed on a pedestal so that it is not directly touching the ground, but many inflatable or pop up” hot tubs don't require this kind of groundwork.</p>
<p>Smaller 2 person spas normally need more frequent water changes than larger 8 person spas (except if 8 people are using the spa more than twice a week!). A primary reason people buy swim spas is to swim laps without needing a big pool. As larger units were designed to accommodate more people, Jacuzzi® incorporated heating and filtration systems to keep the water warm and clean, thus creating the first hot tub in 1970.</p>
<p>Traditionally the water in a hot tub is still, just like a swimming pool, and would only be circulated to heat filter it. Chlorine and disinfectants are used to maintain the hot tub. Pumps - Various pumps are used perhaps a separate circulation pump depending on the design of the Jacuzzi Hot Tub. To use vinegar to clean a hot tub, simply pour a one gallon jug of white vinegar into the tub and turn on the jets through one cycle.</p>
