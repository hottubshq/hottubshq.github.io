<p>If you are looking to have a swimming pool and hot tub combination, a two tank swim spa might be your best option. Swim spas require a solid, level surface to sit on and an electrical supply line (usually 220 volt, similar to a hot tub).

In fact, some studies suggest aquatic exercise may be more effective than on-land workouts for some people with back ailments, according to an article by Rena Goldman in Pool & Spa News Like with osteoarthritis and bone and joints ailments, the secret here lies in the reduction of pressure on your joints provided by the buoyancy of the water.</p>

The extra-wide, open shell design creates the ideal swim channel with virtually no reflective wave while stabilizing hip jets further ensure the perfect swim experience. All Endless Pools® Fitness Systems and SwimCross Exercise Systems feature a durable, two millimetre galvanised steel frame and ABS base pan which together provide superior support and protection from ground contact.</p>
<p>Just remember: no matter how cool the wood hot tubs might look, they are extremely difficult to maintain, so choose something to really ease your stress and not something that will double the work in your home. You can dive into the pool for some exercise and then back into the hot tub where you can warm up and relax your muscles after the invigorating workout.

<p>When replacing or repairing a hot tub pump, it is always a good idea to make sure the existing pump cord is free from nicks or even shorts and that the ends are not corroded. There are usually a couple of different water circuits, with one heating and filtering the water, the other operating the hydrotherapy jets. Some hot tubs on the market may contain air injectors.
