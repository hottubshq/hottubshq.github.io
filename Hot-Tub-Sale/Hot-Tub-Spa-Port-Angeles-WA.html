<p>Swimming in a swim spa adds extra benefits. That is why if you notice, the jets are usually positioned at the most stressed muscles of the body - the calves, neck, some at the back, and at the sole of the feet. We favored those that sell spas with paddlewheel current systems, since they're usually the strongest. The bath water is recirculated through the jets, which keeps the water a bit warmer than air being forced in the bath.</p>
<p>While budget swim spas promise a lesser financial burden initially, much more can go wrong if inferior materials and unskilled labor are used. In fact, some swim spas offer more versatility than large pools. In almost all cases the pumps and pipework are all contained under the bath so space shouldn't be a problem unless you're looking for a larger bath. Our friendly staff members are extremely knowledgeable about all variations of Australian swim spas, plunge pools and hot tubs for sale at competitive prices.</p>
