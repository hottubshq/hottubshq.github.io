<p>Hydropool's Self-Cleaning 570 is a 5 person hot tub that is perfect for two couples. If you're considering an online supplier, Google them to see what type of experiences other customers have had and remember that the cost of the swim spa itself will only be part of the overall cost including delivery, concrete base, fencing and certifier and permit fees. Besides the above there are a few other major differences that can be seen between the two, which we will now take a more in-depth look at, and also approach the benefits that a swim spa can bring.</p>
<p>There is a selling season for hot tubs, spas and swim spas and it begins in spring when consumers start venturing in their backyards again and it ends when the kids are back in school and the holidays begin. Experience the ease of owning your own swim spa and feel the benefits of a healthier lifestyle. Whether it be relaxing in one of many different spas and hot tubs, enjoying a soothing sauna tub, this can help make your family gatherings a joy.</p>
<p>If you are looking to have a swimming pool and hot tub combination, a two tank swim spa might be your best option.

<h3>Treating Your Pool, Spa And Swim Spa Right Elkin</h3>
<p>One of the biggest benefits of a swim spa is that it can be used 365 days a year. One downside is that you cannot use bubble bath, bath oil or bath salts in a jetted tub with water jets. That offers the user finger tip control of the swim current from inside the swim area. We will first take a look at the benefits the swim spa can bring, on the fitness and relaxation side of things. If you're pregnant or you have a health condition like heart disease, ask your doctor if it's safe for you to get into a hot tub.</p>
<p>The reason most people opt for a swim spa is that they don't have enough room for a full-sized swimming pool. The swimming part of a swim spa is what makes it uniquely different than a hot tub alone, however. Always make certain the spa's control system accommodates the heat pump. And if you're interested in swimming laps without installing a massive pool, swim spas are a great alternative. As we evaluated them, we considered their current systems and the types of jets they offer as well as their customer service, selection, prices and accessories.</p>

Funny you should ask, because we happen to have a video that produced in 2008 at the Artesian Spas factory in Las Vegas, NV. The video is actually called "How Do They Build A Hot Tub Spa?", but the model that they are building in the video happens to be a large 16' Swim Spa.
