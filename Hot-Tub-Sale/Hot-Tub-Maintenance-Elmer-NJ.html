Swim spas are only unhealthy if you don't look after them properly. There are so many benefits to owning a swim spa and by following the above seven tips you can be sure to find the best swim spa for your family and needs. One major thing to remember and definitely not overlook is how much space you have to fit your hot tub into.</p>
<p>First of all, Jacuzzi bathtubs are extremely expensive, costing anywhere from $600 to over $15,000 depending on the features they offer. All brands will have different features and components to make them different from other hot tub brands. Hot tubs can be installed in two different ways, either freestanding or inground. Our wider safety access steps and flat stepping areas at both the jet and seating end of the swimspas is functional and astietically pleasing.</p>
