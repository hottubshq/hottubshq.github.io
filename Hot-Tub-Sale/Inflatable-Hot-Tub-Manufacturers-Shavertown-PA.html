<p>Does your spa or hot tub smell? Nordic's DTS, or Dual Therapy System, is exclusive to Nordic Hot Tubs and combines high flow water movement with a circular motion, to massage parts of the body that are forgotten in competitors' spas. Jacuzzi tub is the hot tub which experienced you fun and relaxing and leaves you wanting more. These public swimming pools are generally found as section of a bigger leisure complex or recreational center. Swimming is one of the best methods of building your body's strength and muscle toning, and owning your own swim spa allows you to swim every day without the hassle and running costs of a large, traditional swimming pool, or the expense and effort of visiting a public pool or gym.</p>
<p>The areas around the pump and tubes need clearance as well in case any repairs are needed down the line. If the pH level becomes too low, the water will become acidic, irritating the skin of swimmers and causing corrosive damage to your spa or pool. All Jacuzzi® Hot Tubs have a five stage filtration and ClearRay bulb, ensuring your water is quickly and easily cleared of all debris ready for use. In total, there are 14 swim spas to pick from - that's the largest selection of the companies we reviewed, matched only by Hydropool's inventory.</p>

However, when you use both a spa and a swimming pool, the possibilities and benefits are endless.</p>
