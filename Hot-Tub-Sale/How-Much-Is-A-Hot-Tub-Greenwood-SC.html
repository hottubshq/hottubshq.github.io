<p>Legendary for performance, reliability, and ease of use, they set the standard by which all hot tubs are measured. Hot tubs might not be safe for pregnant women because they increase body temperature. In general, for swim spas the base must be able to support 1000kg per square metre and this requires a level slab that is 50mm (6”) minimum thickness with F72 reinforcing mesh. Our wide selection of hot tubs includes a variety of choices from industry leading manufacturers including HotSprings and Caldera.</p>
<p>Swim spas and spa pools (also known as portable spas or hot tubs) are very similar. We only needed ten shifts in the water (two of our teammates only had to swim once), which I thought was pretty impressive for a group of mostly-first timers. It was basic and even rudimentary, but from that moment on I have been obsessed with swim spas. The reason is air capacity is cut by approximately 75% during water exercise because of the water's pressure on your body.</p>
<p>Swim spas are covered by a thick insulated cover and are lined with an insulation of polyurethane, therefore the cost of running the unit is much less than that of a regular pool and, of course, even lower than the cost of operating both a pool and a hot tub. You do need to have the correct measurements if you plan to use one of these kits for building a swim spa or hot tub enclosure with a hot tub cover because all the materials are pre cut to the lengths that you need for the size of gazebo you choose.</p>
