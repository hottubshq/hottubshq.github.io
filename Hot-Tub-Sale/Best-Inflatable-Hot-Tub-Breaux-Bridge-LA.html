<p>Riptide swim spas and exercise pools delivered and installed by our experienced team. Hot water is a great way to keep the body moving. A Jacuzzi soaking tub is the most common type of tub, and this basic concept is Jacuzzi's foundation for hydrotherapy tubs. Some hot tubs also come with features that Jacuzzi products do not, such as flat-screen TVs and built-in MP3 audio systems. Our Swim Spa River Jets are each powered solely by a 4 HP (6BHP) Hyper Flow Jet Pump. Having the swim spa completely above ground is another option that allows you to fence only the steps (as long as the swim spa is over 1200mm high the height of pool fencing).</p>
<p>When you put Jacuzzi® Pro Grade Pool Equipment in your backyard, you trust its performance. Jacuzzi Pure Air tubs range from a bubbly champagne-like experience to a steadier stream of bubbles, depending entirely on the setting chosen by the user. Typically swim spas are generally about 12 to 24 feet in length. Taking a bath in the Spa Jacuzzi bathtub is a great way to enjoy and release stress after a long day at work.</p>

Others have large pools with a diving board at one end above the water.
