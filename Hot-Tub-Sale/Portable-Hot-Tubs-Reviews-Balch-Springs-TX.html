Although in the water, swimming is a strenuous sport that can induce dehydration - especially when one is swimming for long periods of time. They are ideal as individual features, as part of your spa area, or alongside a sauna, steam room or pool.

Letting your mind go without any worries is mentally comforting to get the maximum workout experience.</p>
