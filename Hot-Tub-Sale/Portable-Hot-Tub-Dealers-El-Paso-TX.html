<p>Once upon a time the average American family would gather nightly around the table to share dinner and swap stories from their hectic days. The J-335IP, hot tub has an FX10 Therapy seat to fit every contour of the body and features 40 PowerPro® jets which deliver an effective hydromassage across the entire body with jets to target key areas including shoulders, wrists and feet. There is a swimming spa intended for toddlers or children. On a weekly basis, you should consider adding an anti-foaming agent to your hot tub's water. The benefits of hydrotherapy, whether in a swimming pool, or in a spa, are wide-spread.</p>
<p>By adding another Jet pump you benefit from the maximum therapy experience by adding jets around the body and under the legs.
