<p>Design in hot tubs has no limits. Homeowners can also hire professionals to clean the Jacuzzi bathtubs for them. This type of hot tub is located in the privacy of your home so it is only viewable to people you are already comfortable with. Jacuzzi Pure Air tubs offer the unique experience of a steady stream of bubbles that soothe the body. Hot tubs have no such current, but the water often swirls and bubbles around sitters as they relax.</p>
<p>The warm water inside the tub can relax spasms, alleviate sprains, backache, and fatigue. This allow you to run your heat pump from your spa controller (not via a separate touchpad), use both heat pump AND electric heater for extra fast heating and extends the life of the heat pump. The heat eases out the tension built up in the muscles and increases the blood flow, which in turn heals the body. With 60 years of experience in manufacturing and a legacy of quality products, you can trust that Jacuzzi® understands quality and is focused on customer satisfaction.</p>
