<p>We all know that buying hot tubs isn't a joke. It's also possible that you might be wanting to build a permanent hydrotherapy pool maybe as an addition to your own pool in your garden in which case this would be referred to as a spa. Swim spas usually only have seating at one end with 2 or 4 powerful swim jets at the other. If you're thinking about investing in a swim spa, you're probably interested in its health and exercise benefits. The water is hot and the jets are powerful which I find amazing for a 110 V appliance.</p>
<p>The drastic price difference while having the same benefits give swim spas an advantage over the other options. There are Hot tub on the marketplace now that are designed for two people only; therefore the tubs are much smaller to the traditional larger hot tubs. These smaller sized swim spas can still accommodate several bathers, although if you're taller than average it might feel a little small. Another great characteristic that comes with owning a swim spa is that its maintenance is so much easier then it would be with owning a swimming pool.</p>
<p>These tubs have a 75 gallon capacity and is a great soaker bath to ease the stress away. First, by insulating the cabinet instead of the shell, Vortex spas recycles lost heat from the pumps and equipment, it also insulates the plumbing that would otherwise lose heat to the environment. Obviously when outside the Hot tub will be more exposed to the elements and you will need to wear bath slippers or equivalent as you walk to the Jacuzzi to keep the water as clear as possible.</p>
