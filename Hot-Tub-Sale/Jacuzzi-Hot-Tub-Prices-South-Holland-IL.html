<p>The hot tub is an attractive and strong focal point when added as a new feature in a home. One stays cool for swimming, and the other stays hot for hot tubbing. For this reason, Vortex Spas use a 4 layer, 8 step Thermabond lamination process not found in most swim spas. Most people see improvement in their symptoms when they simply stop going in hot tubs, but some people may need treatment with corticosteroids or antibiotics, according to a 2006 study from the Mayo Clinic.

Typically it's best to drain the tub and start over with fresh water if bubble bath or high sudsing agents have been added to the hot tub either accidentally or as a prank.</p>
