<p>Don't falsely assume that swim spas are only for the richer due to being costly. Each of the Jacuzzi® hot tubs in the J-300 collection comes with a ProClarity filtration system and a CLEARRAY® purification system. Hot Springs Resort and Spa has a licensed and professional Massage Therapists and Estheticians that provide a variety of relaxing and rejuvenating treatments. Swim spas are an excellent way to get a full body workout in a compact space and are perfect for people that love swimming, but don't have room for a large swimming pool.</p>
<p>When you put Jacuzzi® Pro Grade Pool Equipment in your backyard, you trust its performance. Jacuzzi Pure Air tubs range from a bubbly champagne-like experience to a steadier stream of bubbles, depending entirely on the setting chosen by the user. Typically swim spas are generally about 12 to 24 feet in length. Taking a bath in the Spa Jacuzzi bathtub is a great way to enjoy and release stress after a long day at work.</p>
<p>Also, our Jacuzzi bathtub is designed using topmost grade material and progressive technology in conformity with latest market trends. Due to the hot, damp environment that occurs around a swim spa, even the hardiest of timbers will be susceptible to mold and mildew. You do not drain the water from a hot tub after each use. Jacuzzi tub brings the health benifits too. Swim spas provide space for kids to move around. Adding to Jacuzzi's fabulous range of therapy tubs and installation types are its innovative technologies.</p>
