Instead of seating, they have strong water jets that create a current strong enough for you to swim against. Nevertheless, it's a cost that must be considered before purchasing a new whirlpool Jacuzzi tub. Also you should be aware that Modern Hot Tubs have progressed by leaps and bounds in their use of Heat efficient technology.</p>
