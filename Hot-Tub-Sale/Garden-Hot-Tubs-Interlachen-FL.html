The time-tested performance, attractive appearance and obvious quality is apparent to everyone desiring a no-hassle cover lift.</p>
<p>The most prominent safety feature walk-in tubs bring to the table — the door — also has a downside because you can't fill the tub with water before entering it, which could leave you a bit chilled.
