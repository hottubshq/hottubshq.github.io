<p>Spas and Hot tubs have enjoyed huge popularity of the last few years. This is a spa that is offered at a fitness club or a recreational club as an added facility. Unlike a swimming pool which can be quite costly to install and requires a large backyard, swim spas offer this all-in-one portable package in a box that can be craned into position in an hour. If you plan to heat your swim spa regularly, especially the swim end due to the large amount of water, you need to be able to use a gas or a heat pump as the electric heaters will be very expensive.</p>
<p>It can be difficult to carve out the time you need to focus on your fitness, health, and family. The modular design also allows for pools of varying sizes from 7′ x 12′ to 10′ x 16′ with water depths up to 6′ deep. The idea behind the Jacuzzi tub is to bring the great features of an outdoor hot tub inside. Jacuzzi® J-400 hot tubs come in a variety of configurations including smaller 2-3 person tubs and a large 8-9 person hot tub.</p>
<p>You can have self-contained and portable” unit, you can just get a Swim Spa shell and set it into a deck, you can have a customized Swim spa made for you or you can get a Swim Spa Water Jet and install it into your existing above ground or inground swimming pool. While their selection may appear limited compared to our picks for the best walk-in tub brands , it's easier to narrow down your choices from a few solid American-made tubs with various therapeutic benefits.</p>

<p>Legendary for performance, reliability, and ease of use, they set the standard by which all hot tubs are measured. Hot tubs might not be safe for pregnant women because they increase body temperature. In general, for swim spas the base must be able to support 1000kg per square metre and this requires a level slab that is 50mm (6”) minimum thickness with F72 reinforcing mesh.

If the pH level becomes too low, the water will become acidic, irritating the skin of swimmers and causing corrosive damage to your spa or pool. All Jacuzzi® Hot Tubs have a five stage filtration and ClearRay bulb, ensuring your water is quickly and easily cleared of all debris ready for use. In total, there are 14 swim spas to pick from - that's the largest selection of the companies we reviewed, matched only by Hydropool's inventory.</p>

<p>As water flows through the pipes and plumbing towards the jets it can draw in air so as to make a water air mixture by an action which is known as venturi. Designed for ease of use, durability and carefree maintenance, hot tubs deliver a lifetime of pleasure, wherever you are. Each seat is tactically fitted with various types of massage jets in different positions, mounted in a way to massage every part of the body.</p>
<p>From time to time water is thrown on heated stones, producing a thick cloud of steam and making the room feel hotter. Internal turbines power the part in which you can swim; these generate a current that you swim against - as you would swim against a tide in the ocean - giving you optimal exercise every time you go for a swim. Just about anything you can think of in these type tubs can be installed and operating in a matter of no more than a couple hours time.</p>

By incorporating body jets into the sides of the tub, it became the bath that almost single-handedly created an industry. Another thing to remember if you are thinking of buying an indoor hot tub is that, although they are more convenient, indoor hot tubs require more complex installations than traditional outdoor ones.</p>
