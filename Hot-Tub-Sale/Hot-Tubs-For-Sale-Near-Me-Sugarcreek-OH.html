<p>The hot tub is an attractive and strong focal point when added as a new feature in a home. The Indulgence swim spa is the top of the line for us at Sunbelt Spas. Although ABS based acrylic has proven strength, fibreglass is still sometimes added in order to ensure it maintains its strength alongside supporting the spas water and bather load. When your bathroom space is limited, a corner tub can give you the most out of the space. The next big leap forward came when the Jacuzzi brothers hydrotherapy pump was combined with fibreglass bodywork, a filtration system and electric heating system to create what is essentially the modern day hot tub.</p>
<p>In 1956, the Jacuzzi family created a portable hydrotherapy pump to help treat a family member's painful arthritis. This creates a stronger massage than tubs with the air jets. Equipped with classic filtration systems and just one or two pumps depending on the model, these J-200 Jacuzzi® hot tubs are among Jacuzzi's most affordable models. Swim spas are flexible, durable and practical. In just a few years' time, Jacuzzi became a household name and was quickly used to refer to any and all hot tubs, however incorrectly.</p>
<p>Swim spas are equipped with a long and narrow tank, similar to that of a swimming pool, but on a smaller scale. More compact than standard above ground swimming pools, swimming against the swim spa's powerful counter-current jets will give even the strongest swimmer an excellent work-out. The understructure of a hot tub will determine how well it can support the weight of the water. While shopping for Jacuzzi tubs, you can do so on by popular collection.</p>

<p>Although the larger Jacuzzi family thought this idea was a little weird, the sales grew and soon the bathtub was designed to be a bit larger so as to fit in 2 people.

Many dealerships now display Swim Spas in their stores. We design and manufacture our own hot tubs for public and private use, for indoor or outdoor installation, for frequent or occasional use and for relaxing or to supplement your fitness regime.</p>

<p>In a world where stress accumulates easily on us all, an Arctic Spa hot tub is a respite from the storm. Some people use the internet to make their choice and then they go physically to the dealer and buy the tubs. The best way to experience Jacuzzi is installing it in the homes to have wonderful memories of soaking afresh anytime you want. Getting a Jacuzzi tub installation done allows homeowners to enjoy all the benefits of an outdoor hot tub indoors.</p>
<p>For the most part, swim spas costing between $10,000 and $20,000 are built with cost rather than quality in mind. Although it is small, at least compared to SwimEx's other spas, it's big enough to accommodate several people with enough room for all to exercise. Swim spas also provide something lap pools do not — hydro - massage in a comfortable hot tub setting.

The you must consider also that where a hot tub is subject to regular use it will accumulate natural body oils, perspiration, and other material that may mark the water line.</p>
