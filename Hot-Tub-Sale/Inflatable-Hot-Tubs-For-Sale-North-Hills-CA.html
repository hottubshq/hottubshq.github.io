<p>One of the most obvious benefits of using a swimming pool and spa, for the average person, is the simple act of relaxation. These tubs are usually made to accommodate two to four people and are made from plastic or vinyl. Not only will the Vortex Hybrid Heat Pump heat your spa economically. We provide this Corner Jacuzzi Bathtubon several designs & other related options as per the needs of customers. After an hour of soaking in the 100-104 degree waters, enjoy a health-promoting massage by one of our nationally certified and state licensed massage therapists offering a range of massage modalities from relaxation to deeper more therapeutic massages.</p>
<p>Even though the swimming space is smaller than in a regular pool, it is still larger than most swim spas, and you have the option of including swim jets if you want a more intensive swimming experience. Furthermore, customers can avail this acrylic bathtub from us at market prices. All Vortex swim spa frames use top quality, durable steel. Complete Jacuzzi or whirlpool kits with strategically placed Hydro-jet Nozzles.</p>
<p>The whirlpool bath was invented in the early 1940s by Candidi Jacuzzi, a second generation Jacuzzi. It's like a hot tub - but with even more benefits.

At Master Spas, we make buying a swim spa just as relaxing as owning one.</p>
<h2>Mini Hot Tub Spa North Hills California</h2>
<p>A Jacuzzi needs to have an energy saver system so as to be more economical in use and also to be more green to the planet - obviously an energy efficient hot tub will save the consumer money and use less precious energy thereby reducing ones carbon footprint which is very politically correct. Jacuzzi TheraPro jets combine power with higher water flow and air integration for a more vigorous and even massage.</p>
<p>Approved safety locks - A quality approved locking cover is just as accepted as a fully fenced spa pool. Since every policy is a little different in their treatment of hot tubs, make sure you check with your insurance provider or read your policy to make sure you understand the specifics of your coverage. It might even be called a spa as in the Lay zee spa brand in the UK, but, if it's freestanding, semi-permanent and has inbuilt filtration and heating then it's a hot tub.</p>
<h3>Premium Swim Spas & Hot Tubs  North Hills</h3>
<p>Every Jacuzzi® hot tub has been researched and engineered to deliver advanced hydrotherapy and with patented jet technology a truly unique hot tub experience.

<p>Keep young children away from spas or hot tubs unless there is constant adult supervision. The food coloring will not damage any of the components in your hot tub, but you will have to drain it afterwards and refill it with fresh water. Of course, the Fastlane Pools Fitness System is so much more than a swim spa. There is a new invention called a Fast Lane Swim Jet unit that can be been retrofitted into most existing swimming pools.</p>

<p>Since private pools are used exclusively by a few people, these swimming pools are usually smaller than public pools. Spa and hot tub water therapies are highly valued for their relaxing, rejuvenating, and naturally rehabilitative qualities, and hot tubs remain a favorite social setting.
