A swim spa is an oversized spa pool that has been cleverly designed to allow you to swim, jog and work out using the power of jets to keep your motion stationery.</p>
<p>The risks involved highlight the importance of using the correct chemical products for your pool and swim spa. Gone are the days where hot tubs are placed in one spot and stay there indefinitely. You should also remove and clean the Hot Tubs filter thoroughly making sure you remove any contamination.
