<p>If you want a bathtub that can double as a place to wash your body, as well as soak and relax, you will want to consider jetted bathtubs, or the more common name, whirlpool tub. But spa” is also used as the American term for a hot tub equipped with strong jets that mix air into the water for a more pronounced massage effect. The point is this, if you spend a little time in your hot tub and get yourself to the point where you really enjoy this time, then you are doing much better than becoming addicted to pain killers. Take the first step toward finding your hot tub by browsing Hot Spring spa collections.</p>
<p>One end of our swim spa features two ergonomic therapy seats designed to provide the ultimate massage experience while focusing on different muscle groups. Swim spas sometimes offer similar properties, but some seats may not have jets.

<p>As Canada's largest hot tub company Arctic Spas® is committed to being a leader in pursuing tougher energy use legislation and will continue to drive the agenda of manufacturing responsible, safe and efficient products, and honesty in advertising. Kids love swimming under the twin laminar water feature jets. These jets actually push air into the tub instead of water causing a gentle massaging feeling. Our offered Modern Bath Tubis an integral part of places such as spas and other wellness centers.</p>

Both the Finestra and Jacuzzi Walk-in Tub lines come with the RapidHeat in-line heater which maintains the water temperature longer, Fast-fill and Quick Drain which fill and drain the tub two times faster than standard faucets and drains, heated seats and backrests.</p>

Install fencing or invest in a sturdy cover that kids can't fall though, even if they step on it.

An H2X Fitness Swim Spa allows you to exercise, relax, and entertain in the convenience and privacy of your backyard, year-round.</p>
<p>Hot tubs are becoming very popular due to their many benefits. Don't jump straight from the hot tub into the pool to cool off. The tub will have a wooden seat or bench running around the walls, so that it's easy for people to sit down and relax. Hydrotherapy is a treatment you can avail of in a hot tub for relaxation with the combination of heat, massage and buoyancy. For that reason, most people have no idea what a swim spa really costs.</p>
