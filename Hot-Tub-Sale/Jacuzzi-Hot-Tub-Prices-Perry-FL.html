<p>Mums and Bubs swimming lesson sessions are designed for babies aged between 6 and 24 months. Many have what is known as thermal” spa facilities which basically means that there will be hydrotherapy pools, possibly steam rooms, ice caves, salt steam rooms, feature showers and maybe saunas at different temperatures. However, larger swim spas have dual-zone” heating; the primary section for the workouts is cold, while the second one for relaxing is hot. The time-tested performance, attractive appearance and obvious quality is apparent to everyone desiring a no-hassle cover lift.</p>

This is why we make Royal Spa Swim Spas from components that can be found at most pool and spa supply stores.</p>
