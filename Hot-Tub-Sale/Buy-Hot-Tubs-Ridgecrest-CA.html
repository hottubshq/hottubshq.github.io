<p>Swim Spas are smaller than typical swimming pools and this makes them much easier to drain for cleaning and maintenance. Between 2000 and 2014, outbreaks from treated pools and hot tubs were linked to more than 27,000 infections and eight deaths in the United States. They are often installed in houses as a replacement for a regular bathtub. Producing a steady, smooth current, single-shell models from Endless Pool Fitness Systems are perfect for those who enjoy total-body aquatic activity and complete relaxation.</p>
<p>This flexibility has allowed thousands of people to realize the dream of "endless" swimming at their own home. Quite simply, a Swim Spa is a machine that allows you to swim continuously against a water current. During the mid-2000's, a few keen hot tub manufacturers saw that there might be a larger market opening up in the Swim Spa industry, and a number of them changed their production lines to also produce the larger, more bulky Swim Spas.</p>
<p>At that point in time, the Swim Spa did not really seem like such a great bargain. We have a large variety of hot tubs for sale. Some people prefer water temperatures to be at about body temperature of about 98.6. When someone who reacts badly to very hot water gets in a too hot spa they may have a heat stroke. You can find the same benefits of hot tubs in swim spas. Finding the best hot tubs for sale doesn't have to be difficult.</p>
