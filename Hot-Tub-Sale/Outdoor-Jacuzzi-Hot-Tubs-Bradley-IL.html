<p>Did you know that a swimming pool is not only fun to swim and relax in? Aside from the consideration of a spa's heat pump, the insulation within a spa pool determines how much output energy is required to maintain it. There are three main insulation systems used today, it is dependable on the company, manufacturer and model as to which one is adopted. The TruSwim® unique dual propulsion design guarantees an incomparable aquatic fitness experience with endless possibilities. We have been researching, ranking and reviewing swim spas for more than four years.</p>

<p>Another advantage of portable hot tubs are they can be looked after much better, lets just say that you were having a terrible winter, with a normal hot tub you would only be able to cover the tub which would ultimately still lead to wear and tear throughout the year.
