<p>Even though swim spas are hugely beneficial from a health and wellness perspective, they suffer from one major drawback. Swim spas are not an ideal choice for families, as only one person can comfortably swim in a swim spa at any time. The Jacuzzi brand tradition of innovation in hydro-massage has made Jacuzzi the most desired product in whirlpool bathing. Our spas come with valuable customer and technical support for the lifetime of the spa. Visit Jacuzzi Hot Tubs and Outdoor Living to discover all the ways you can benefit from the high standards and the low maintenance offered by a HydroPool.</p>
<p>Jacuzzi is simply a brand name of hot tub. Deluxe 6-person hot tub with 40 hydrotherapy massage jets and a full body lounge. Swim spa: This is a small pool that uses powerful jets to propel water toward you so you can get a workout by swimming against the tide, so to speak. These signs should make you a lot more cautious about buying that particular hot tub, although more often than not a lack of treating the water will not harm the performance of the spa.</p>
<p>Indoor hot tubs offer many conveniences that can't be found with outdoor tubs. If you are able to use a gas heater or heat pump (which offers savings of up to 75%). This bathtub exceeded my expectations. They say that swimmers are more prone to dehydration because it causes high levels of exertion in the body, but swimmers do not feel the urge to drink because they are immersed within the water and therefore the brain is not aware of the need for water, and other liquids.</p>

The best swim spas are designed so you swim in place against a current, rather than swimming traditional lengths in a pool.</p>

<p>Unsurprisingly there has been a bit of a resurgence in recent years with wooden barrel type hot tubs becoming more popular. But these jets create a current for you to swim against to strengthen muscle groups and extend your endurance. Deluxe 6-person hot tub with 20 hydrotherapy massage jets. One unusual ailment linked to Jacuzzis is "hot tub lung," a lung disease caused by bacteria that can thrive in warm water.</p>
<p>This spinning wheel has indentations that move water through the pump and create the pressure in the pipes needed to keep water circulating and moving through the spa plumbing. Swim spas have one amazing addition that traditional swimming pools lack—the hydrotherapeutic experience. You can program a customized swimming experience to suit individual preferences, monitor your progress, and swim whenever you like in the comfort of your own home.</p>
<p>Additionally, these swim spas are extremely relaxing and induce hydrotherapy with massaging jets and contour seating. If you want to heat your swim spa at all you need to consider buying a dual zone swim spa so you can use the electric heater(s) to affordably heat just the spa end only and take the edge off” the temperature in the swim end. This is due to the types of pumps, swim jets and plumbing used by many brands and the fact that they do not understand the technology involved.</p>
