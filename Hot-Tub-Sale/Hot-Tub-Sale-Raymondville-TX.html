<p>That wonderful feeling you get whenever you sit back in a hot tub is because of the way your body reacts to the heat and jets of water. Jacuzzi® is the name that defines the hot tub experience.

<p>Note: With the exception of Hydropool's Self-Cleaning swim spas , almost all mid-range and high-end swim spas still utilize hot tub filtration systems, despite using other specialized swim spas parts such as pumps and jets.

<p>A night in my hot tub before bed and sometimes I the morning before work. The internet can be a perfect place to purchase a cheap hot tub instead of from a hot tub dealer's showroom, but be careful with internet hot tub retailers as they might not be genuine, they could be selling poor quality hot tubs or not be around in the future to support you with warranty problems or spare parts like filters. Not only the initial cost is lower than swim pools, but the use of water, the required heating, and the chemicals are less due to the size difference.</p>
<p>Additionally, these swim spas are extremely relaxing and induce hydrotherapy with massaging jets and contour seating. If you want to heat your swim spa at all you need to consider buying a dual zone swim spa so you can use the electric heater(s) to affordably heat just the spa end only and take the edge off” the temperature in the swim end. This is due to the types of pumps, swim jets and plumbing used by many brands and the fact that they do not understand the technology involved.</p>
