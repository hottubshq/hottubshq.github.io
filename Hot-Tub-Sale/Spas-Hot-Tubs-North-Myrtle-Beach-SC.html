Jacuzzi Water Villas are water bungalows in the Maldives, located over-the-water, in the lagoon… a short walk along your private jetty to this secluded hideaway featuring a larger bedroom, wood floor, espresso machine, a spacious bathroom, a private walled-in outdoor area featuring a Jacuzzi for two under the stars”, a wooden sundeck with chaise lounges, a shaded area, tropical plants, a private sundeck with stairs into the sea and the most magnificent views of all.</p>
<p>The areas around the pump and tubes need clearance as well in case any repairs are needed down the line. If the pH level becomes too low, the water will become acidic, irritating the skin of swimmers and causing corrosive damage to your spa or pool. All Jacuzzi® Hot Tubs have a five stage filtration and ClearRay bulb, ensuring your water is quickly and easily cleared of all debris ready for use. In total, there are 14 swim spas to pick from - that's the largest selection of the companies we reviewed, matched only by Hydropool's inventory.</p>

However, when you use both a spa and a swimming pool, the possibilities and benefits are endless.</p>
