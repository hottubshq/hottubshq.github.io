<p>A hot tub is a large home made or manufactured tub filled with hot water. We are offering Waterfall Jacuzzito our client and our product is made of good quality. These swim spas are usually made in North America (making parts easier and cheaper to source) and come with a more robust warranty. Making this a great time to buy a hot tub. Hydrotherapy from home spas allows unique health benefits. The 5.5 Series Aqua Swim is a plunge pool, never ending swimming pool, hydrotherapy spa and aqua-aerobics centre all in one.</p>
<p>Due to the advanced design and high-grade materials that's used to craft each and every Hydropool Swim Spa, they can offer many years of use. It is smaller than a regular swimming pool, but larger than a spa, so it offers enough space to swim in. However, like a spa, it is equipped with spa jets, so you can enjoy the benefits of relaxation and pain relief that hydrotherapy offers. This is why we have designed our swim spas from the ground up to be used all year.</p>
<p>Relaxing in a warm jetted hot tub is very relaxing and good for your mental health. Ensure you have plenty of space to fit the hot tub, as well as easy access to the power source and enough room to safely get in and out of the hot tub. Hydropool has swim spas for relaxing, working out and even a little bit of both. Vortex Spas feature advanced water treatment technologies that work together in tandem with a light chemical boost to keep your water crystal clear and healthy.</p>

<p>Compared to a pool, the ratio of people to volume of water is drastically different to in a spa, prompting unexpected spikes in pH. A jump in pH can cause the water to become alkaline and cloudy, leading to scale build up in your spa. In addition, swimming can be great for runners recovering from injuries since it not only helps maintain good physical health but also improves mental health. The insulation around the cabinet traps in waste heat created by the pumps and heater, greatly increasing the energy efficiency of the swim spa as a whole.</p>
<p>Safe for the Whole Family - The swim spa is a great place to encourage family time. Jacuzzi features multiple different installation types for its tubs. Through it's sterilizing effect, Vortex's Purezone Spa Pool UV steriliser will not only make your spa safe for you and your family, but also reduce your use of chemical sanitisers. A proper swim spa where you swim against a current that is created by multiple pumps and special swim jets.</p>

<p>Legendary for performance, reliability, and ease of use, they set the standard by which all hot tubs are measured. Hot tubs might not be safe for pregnant women because they increase body temperature. In general, for swim spas the base must be able to support 1000kg per square metre and this requires a level slab that is 50mm (6”) minimum thickness with F72 reinforcing mesh. Our wide selection of hot tubs includes a variety of choices from industry leading manufacturers including HotSprings and Caldera.</p>
<p>Finally, if you live in an area, which has hard water, then you will need to add an anti-scaling chemical to stop the build-up of calcium deposits on the sides and floor of your hot tub. The powerful jets enable you to swim in place just as you would in a regular pool or in the lake. Designed to improve your lifestyle and offer a better way of taking care of yourself, Jacuzzi® hot tubs are the most complete and versatile synthesis of shared well-being.</p>
