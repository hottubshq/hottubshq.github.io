<p>Spas and Hot tubs have enjoyed huge popularity of the last few years. This is a spa that is offered at a fitness club or a recreational club as an added facility. Unlike a swimming pool which can be quite costly to install and requires a large backyard, swim spas offer this all-in-one portable package in a box that can be craned into position in an hour. If you plan to heat your swim spa regularly, especially the swim end due to the large amount of water, you need to be able to use a gas or a heat pump as the electric heaters will be very expensive.</p>
<p>When you put Jacuzzi® Pro Grade Pool Equipment in your backyard, you trust its performance.

Typically swim spas are generally about 12 to 24 feet in length. Taking a bath in the Spa Jacuzzi bathtub is a great way to enjoy and release stress after a long day at work.</p>
