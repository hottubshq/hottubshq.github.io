<p>The hot tub is an attractive and strong focal point when added as a new feature in a home. The Indulgence swim spa is the top of the line for us at Sunbelt Spas. Although ABS based acrylic has proven strength, fibreglass is still sometimes added in order to ensure it maintains its strength alongside supporting the spas water and bather load. When your bathroom space is limited, a corner tub can give you the most out of the space. The next big leap forward came when the Jacuzzi brothers hydrotherapy pump was combined with fibreglass bodywork, a filtration system and electric heating system to create what is essentially the modern day hot tub.</p>
<p>The heat widens blood vessels, which sends nutrient-rich blood throughout your body. With the optional integrated Wi-Fi module that works with the Balboa Water Group Wi-Fi Spa Control app, you can remotely control how your hot tub operates, including the lighting, water temperature and running massage pumps. Take a look at the photos below, which demonstrate the various types of Swim Spas in different environments.</p>
<p>Your body opens up the blood vessels because it thinks you are getting too warm and the ones near the surface of the skin relax in an effort to release heat. In addition, we look for swim spa manufacturers that offer a variety of extras to enhance your swim spa experience, including spa covers, underwater workout equipment, sound systems, railings and LED lights. Best of all, it helps keep the Jacuzzi bathtub free of bacteria.</p>
<h2>Hot Tub Home Wartburg Tennessee</h2>
