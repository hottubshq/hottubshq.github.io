<p>OK, class ~ it's time to define the true meaning of the different types of hot water therapy. It has the new River Jet swim system with Viper pumps, and plenty of water features. Whisper-quiet motors, colorful lighting, dancing air bubbles, powerful jets — your bath is an expression of yourself and an extension of how you want to feel. Most indoor kinds hold one or two people simply because the available space is limited to the standard size bathroom. Similar to a regular bathtub you would see in a home, these hot tubs, sometimes called whirlpool baths or Jacuzzis, are filled with water for each use than drained when your soaking is complete.</p>
<p>Some models use an air blower to force air through a separate set of jets for a different "bubbly" massage effect; this is a separate system from the induced air. Whether your choice of exercise is running, walking, jogging, or working out at the gym, the fitness of hot tubs and spas are just what you need for those tired, aching muscles at affordable prices. This process is particularly crucial for spas which are manufactured in extreme weather environments e.g., very hot, very cold or humid conditions.</p>
<p>After all, Endless Pools pioneered propeller-driven swim-in-place technology in 1988 and has remained the industry-leader for nearly 30 years. When asked What is the largest swim spa?” we tell customers that Hydropool has two of the largest swim spas available on the market. The photo to the left shows the swimming end of the Swim Spa. Just be sure that you can access any of the hot tub workings that you may need to at any time.</p>

Wooden hot tubs are still used in some spas and resorts, for the special touch they enhance the interior design with a certain "je ne sai quois" reminding us of long-forgotten times when there were no modern bathrooms and people had to bath in wooden tubs.</p>
