Many have what is known as thermal” spa facilities which basically means that there will be hydrotherapy pools, possibly steam rooms, ice caves, salt steam rooms, feature showers and maybe saunas at different temperatures.

<p>However, you can turn the jets off and just soak, and many swim spas have an area designed just for that - essentially, there is a hot tub area in your spa. It also allows you to use your heat pump to cool the water in summer which is a very valuable benefit. Come and visit our showrooms where you can see our huge range of quality Spas and Swim Spas.
