<p>Hot tubs and spas are becoming increasingly more popular and they are to be found in many homes. According to Wikipedia : a Hot Tub is a large tub or small pool full of heated water and used for hydrotherapy or pleasure. Add warmth and water movement and hot tubbing becomes the stuff of lifetime memories. If you do use a hot tub, turn down the temperature and limit your time in the water to less than 10 minutes. A Spa system will use air to push the water around your bath and create that bubble and whirl effects.</p>
<p>The air jets on a Spa system will be on the bottom of your bath. Hot tubs are available with both cottages holidays, and lodge holidays. Forget about the anxiety of public pools, the drive to fancy spas to pamper yourself, or searching for physical therapy centers. Sometimes all the water jets may automatically move or rotate, again providing the effect of a massage. Warm water is known to soothe muscles. A pump with a higher horsepower is going to cost you more - so make sure that you understand how much force you need to apply to suck the water in.
