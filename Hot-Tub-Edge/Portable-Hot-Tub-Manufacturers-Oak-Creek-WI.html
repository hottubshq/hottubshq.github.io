<p>Hot tub pumps are critical for any spa. You want to stay hydrated while soaking and drinking a cool glass” of water, fruit juice or tea is such a pleasant way to go. But it's so easy to drop a glass” made of glass and have it shatter on the way to the tub or once you're soaking. Hot tubs are usually heated using an electric or natural gas heater, though there are also submersible wood fire hot tub heaters, as well as solar hot water systems. This includes a self-cleaning option and an independent heater so your water heater does not take such a beating every time it tries to fill up the tub.</p>
<p>And some hot tubs have too high a level of chemicals. Buoyancy-simulating Levitator Jets are angled upwards toward the swimmer to replicate the natural buoyancy that would be present as you swim in open water. The wooden tub looks a bit like an oversized wine barrel and needs a permanent platform to stand on. The wooden spa is heated by fire, is better outside and needs a fair bit of maintenance to keep it in good working order.</p>
<p>Hot tubs are able to do these because of three very important factors: heat, buoyancy, and massage. However, it's often said the water disco light mode at night is the favourite Vortex Swim Spa feature of all.

<p>A good way to locate leaks in your hot tub is by using food coloring and by adding it to the water.
