<p>There are various kinds of spas you can indulge in as per your requirements and convenience. The HL 630 Healthy Living model is one of the best-selling spas in the Healthy Living series. This acrylic hot tub is probably the closest thing you'll get to a real Jacuzzi in your garden. It caters for all of your relaxation, exercise & entertainment needs in one luxury swim spa. Think about the rules posted at public pools, including no running or diving, showering before and after swimming, and no peeing in the water.</p>
<p>Ask any family with a Vortex Swim Spa and they will tell you the kids absolutely LOVE THEM. From the jetted seats to do a massage for your muscles, the dual zone with hot and cold water, and the temperature control panels to offer a great healing experience for tore muscles, pains, and cramps. By producing a continuous current, swim spa water pressure encourages continuous swimming motion, producing a more effective exercise regimen.</p>
<p>The warm water inside the tub can relax spasms, alleviate sprains, backache, and fatigue. This allow you to run your heat pump from your spa controller (not via a separate touchpad), use both heat pump AND electric heater for extra fast heating and extends the life of the heat pump. The heat eases out the tension built up in the muscles and increases the blood flow, which in turn heals the body. With 60 years of experience in manufacturing and a legacy of quality products, you can trust that Jacuzzi® understands quality and is focused on customer satisfaction.</p>

This hydrotherapeutic method will not harm the hot tub although it will take some time for the filters to effectively remove the vinegar from the water. You can eventually have your own swimming spa in front of your house. Hot tubs are said to work therapeutically. The best swim spas are designed so you swim in place against a current, rather than swimming traditional lengths in a pool.</p>
<p>Since a whirl pool is a place where people spend a considerable amount of time inside, it should have good wide panoramic views so as to avoid monotony and boredom. Swim spas offer all the comfort and benefits of hot tubs, but they come in a larger size, almost like a small swimming pool. Start by thinking about how you plan to use the swim spa — therapy, relaxation, exercise or all of the above. The Jacuzzi water heater model is the king of them all.</p>

Swim spas are extremely easy and convenient when it comes to their use, cleaning, and installing. You should always check that all the pumps and blowers are working and that the heater control lights indicate that the heater is on when the spa is calling for heat.</p>

Our collection of swim and fitness spas are the pinnacle of performance and style providing improved wellness and a better quality of life conveniently at home.</p>
<p>Experience the heated-water hydrotherapy and jetted hydromassage benefits of a hot tub, with the increased hydrostatic-pressure benefits of a swim spa. Sure, the waters were colder than I usually like, and my body had to endure a bit of punishment it's not accustomed to (plus, there's shrinkage), but the thrill generated by the competition convinced me that adding open water swims to my racing repertoire is a definite must.</p>
