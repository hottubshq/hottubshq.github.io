<p>A lot of people ask what is the difference between a swim spa and a swimming pool? When you install your hot tub or pool you may or may not have used conduit or a duct that is buried in your garden for protecting the cables, if there is spare capacity, you can feed your power and cable leads through the duct to the location normally on a wall near the pool or hot tub. While some spas still use wooden tubs, there are many private spas that use specially designed hot tubs and whirlpools to create a relaxing atmosphere for their clients while still using the healing power of warm water.</p>
<p>Swim spas made in North America are generally more reliable than those made elsewhere. Due to the fact that a Jacuzzi bathtub is considered a luxury, it can be fairly expensive to install.

<p>A Jacuzzi needs to have an energy saver system so as to be more economical in use and also to be more green to the planet - obviously an energy efficient hot tub will save the consumer money and use less precious energy thereby reducing ones carbon footprint which is very politically correct. Jacuzzi TheraPro jets combine power with higher water flow and air integration for a more vigorous and even massage.</p>
<p>In the pool most people simply swim lengths and you can choose whether to swim for a set amount of time, or a number of lengths. Hot tubs must always ALWAYS be kept clean. Sitting in a sauna bath increases skin temperature, causes the pulse rate to double, and thus, increases blood circulation. Today, Jacuzzi features an expanded luxury tub environment, with four types of therapeutic tubs. Our hot tubs are extremely durable, but should anything go wrong, you won't be left high and dry.</p>
