<p>I have been asked this question by so many customers. Embrace the ultimate aquatic workout experience with a Swim Pro Swim & Fitness Spa. You can find more in-depth information on the benefits of whirlpool baths and discover whether a whirlpool bath is the right choice for you. As the Jacuzzi brand became more famous, people started referring to a hot tub as a jacuzzi. I would not buy a Jacuzzi Hot Tub if the majority of the jets were unadjustable for one thing they can be painful.</p>
<p>The difference with swim spas is that they're often larger than a standard spa pool and have an open area at one end without seating. If an Extreme Lighting Package is installed on your spa, each corner will light up to match the color of light in your hot tub. When you allow the massaging jets to massage your sore spots or even just hold your feet up to the circulating massaging water you will immediately feel better and your feet won't hurt much at all.</p>
<p>It may be possible to place a Jacuzzi Style Hot Tub in side your property. Jacuzzi® Pro Grade Pool Equipment is built strong. Our swim pools have many features including stainless-steel hardware, therapy seating, and premium jets. The TidalFit exercise pool is built to the same world class quality standards that you would expect from May Manufacturing, LLC, who is renowned throughout the spa industry. The caution about not bathing in very warm water still applies, so keep the temperature warm but not hot.</p>
