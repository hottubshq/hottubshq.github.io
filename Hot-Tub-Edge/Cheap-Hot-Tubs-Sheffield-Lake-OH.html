<p>The reason most people opt for a swim spa is that they don't have enough room for a full-sized swimming pool.

<p>A cracked or damaged shell of a hot tub can be very costly or impossible to repair. One of the brothers, Roy Jacuzzi, invented the hot tub in 1968. With powerful massaging jets penetrating deep into the skin, slipping into a swim spa is the answer to instant rejuvenation after a long day, refreshing and revitalizing a tired body and mind. Some manufacturers use full-foam when they make their Hot Tubs and these are in my view and that of very large American manufacturers an old design as they need to be able to vent off the motor-generated heat to the outside air where of course the latent heat contained win in the unit is just simply wasted.</p>

If you've never learned how to swim you should take lessons at your local pool to learn the basics, but after that it is simply a matter of swimming length after length.</p>
<p>For the most part, swim spas costing between $10,000 and $20,000 are built with cost rather than quality in mind. Although it is small, at least compared to SwimEx's other spas, it's big enough to accommodate several people with enough room for all to exercise.
