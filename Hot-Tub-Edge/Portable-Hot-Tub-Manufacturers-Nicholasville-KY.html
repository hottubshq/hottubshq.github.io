<p>If you want a bathtub that can double as a place to wash your body, as well as soak and relax, you will want to consider jetted bathtubs, or the more common name, whirlpool tub.

Take the first step toward finding your hot tub by browsing Hot Spring spa collections.</p>
<p>The drastic price difference while having the same benefits give swim spas an advantage over the other options. There are Hot tub on the marketplace now that are designed for two people only; therefore the tubs are much smaller to the traditional larger hot tubs. These smaller sized swim spas can still accommodate several bathers, although if you're taller than average it might feel a little small. Another great characteristic that comes with owning a swim spa is that its maintenance is so much easier then it would be with owning a swimming pool.</p>

<p>Bacteria like a warm moist environment to grow in. You need to make sure they don't get it. If you wear a swimsuit in the hot tub, take it off immediately when you get out. Hot tubs can rightly be considered spa treatments on a domestic scale, an ideal solution when the limited or inadequate space, or technical impediments, do not allow to have a normal size swimming pool. The Bellavista collection comes in your choice of rectangular and triangular shapes, and is available in all four of Jacuzzi's luxury tub experiences: Soaking Bath, Pure Air, Whirlpool, and Salon Spa.</p>
<p>The hot water in a spa helps keep your blood circulating better. Every so often, it is a good idea to consider adding a water sparkle agent to keep your hot tub looking bright and clear. Hotels are famous for advertising an in-room Jacuzzi, when it's actually a spa made by some other manufacturer. By reducing the temperature drop required before the heater switches on, Reactive Heater Control provides more consistent spa water temperatures and lowers your daily operating costs.</p>
