<p>Hot Tubs are a fantastic accessory to have in your garden or conservatory, to be able to have a hot steaming hot tub ready for you and your partner to unwind when every you want so you are able to soak away all your tension and tired muscles. Since private pools are used exclusively by a few people, these swimming pools are usually smaller than public pools. Spa and hot tub water therapies are highly valued for their relaxing, rejuvenating, and naturally rehabilitative qualities, and hot tubs remain a favorite social setting. Our standard wood-fired hot tubs are equipped with NO jets and filters. Some people like a little bit of texture that gives you a feel similar to that of an in ground hot tub.</p>
<p>It is important to note, though, that the overall size of a swim spa is different from the amount of usable swimming space it contains. Most swim spas found in Canada fall into the mid-range category; costing between $20,000-$35,000. Your swim spa will be the perfect outlet for relaxation, leisure, fun with family. The temperature in an unheated walk-in tub drops to 98.6 in 10 minutes, requiring the bather to add more hot water to remain comfortable.</p>

Whether you're looking for a large hot tub to entertain friends and family during get-togethers or are looking for something for personal and compact, we have what you need. Shopping for a hot tub should be an easy experience.</p>
