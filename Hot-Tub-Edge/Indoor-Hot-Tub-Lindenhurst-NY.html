<p>Your swim spa should be heat pump ready” and you should try and buy a swim spa with a heat pump compatible controller. In a Swim Spa, you are swimming in place as water rushes past you causing a loss of buoyancy that would be normally produced as you pull yourself up and over static water with every stroke. This then pairs with a bigger pump which is in charge of fueling the spas jets. They then managed to create a swimming spa which is more convenient to use compared to outdoor activities.</p>

<p>And while a number of studies have touted the benefits of swimming over every other form of exercise (including jogging and walking!), and include swimming as a recommended form of exercise for everything from increasing the chances of conception in women to easing the suffering of those with Fibromyalgia, very few insurance plans offer any sort of coverage or assistance when making the purchase of a swimming spa.</p>

In the late 1960s, Roy Jacuzzi, a third-generation Jacuzzi toyed with the idea of marketing the pump-fitted bath tub dubbed the 'Roman Bathtub' to cater for the growing need for leisure. When Swim Spas first came on the market about 10 years ago, they were priced in the $25,000 range. By having a smaller tub the volume of water is a lot less therefore running cost are reduced due to the heater having less water to heat.</p>
<p>The American Bath Factory Champagne Jester Jetted Rolltop is a great example of the functionality of jetted bathtubs. Instead of seating, they have strong water jets that create a current strong enough for you to swim against. Nevertheless, it's a cost that must be considered before purchasing a new whirlpool Jacuzzi tub. Also you should be aware that Modern Hot Tubs have progressed by leaps and bounds in their use of Heat efficient technology.</p>
