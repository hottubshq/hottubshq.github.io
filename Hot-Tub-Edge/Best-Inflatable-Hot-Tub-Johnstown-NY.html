<p>Jacuzzi is a large bath or a pool like structure that is equipped electrically to sprout jets of water and air bubbles from different points at the occupants. Some models even have a swim spa and hot tub combo, so you can massage those tired and aching muscles after a morning workout. Most complaints were about walk-in tubs in general rather than Jacuzzi itself. We're concerned with your experience for the life of your Fitness or Exercise System ownership. Here are some easy ways that you can find a leak in your hot tub.

We recommend that you consult a plumber to calculate precisely what size water heater you'll need for a walk-in tub so you won't shortchange the rest of your household while bathing.</p>
