<p>Spas and Hot tubs have enjoyed huge popularity of the last few years. This is a spa that is offered at a fitness club or a recreational club as an added facility. Unlike a swimming pool which can be quite costly to install and requires a large backyard, swim spas offer this all-in-one portable package in a box that can be craned into position in an hour. If you plan to heat your swim spa regularly, especially the swim end due to the large amount of water, you need to be able to use a gas or a heat pump as the electric heaters will be very expensive.</p>
<p>Even though the swimming space is smaller than in a regular pool, it is still larger than most swim spas, and you have the option of including swim jets if you want a more intensive swimming experience. Furthermore, customers can avail this acrylic bathtub from us at market prices. All Vortex swim spa frames use top quality, durable steel. Complete Jacuzzi or whirlpool kits with strategically placed Hydro-jet Nozzles.</p>
<p>Many public pools require women and men with long hair to wear a swim cap while in the pool. Salt can clog the motor that powers air or water jets on other brands or rust out the pump or heater. Heat pumps provide only great benefits when added to your spa pool or swim spa. Take a look at all the wonderful videos on our video page to get a feel for all the different pools, spas and swim spas on the market today.</p>
