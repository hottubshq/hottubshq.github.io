<p>Family owned Sacramento dealer offering affordable high quality Turbo Spas and Swim Spas. You are probably thinking, Yeah, this sounds great, but it probably costs like a trillion dollars.” That is a common misconception about Swim Spas…that they are only for the fabulously wealthy. Illumatherapy also offers four points of entry, with two on each side of the tub, and air bubbles spraying from the jets give the appearance of dancing as they reflect the light. The blowers make the hot tub feel like you've got your own personal geyser - forcing air from the bottom of the pool, and creating a very relaxing environment for you.</p>
<p>One end of our swim spa features two ergonomic therapy seats designed to provide the ultimate massage experience while focusing on different muscle groups. Swim spas sometimes offer similar properties, but some seats may not have jets. The first to transform bathing into an experience, Jacuzzi® leads the industry with new product styles and innovative hydrotherapy. I had very limited space and so a swimming pool wasn't an option.</p>
<p>Some swim spas may cost more upfront, but you get higher quality workmanship that costs you less to operate and maintain. This is ideal if you want to enjoy the spa experience in the privacy of your own property, and can be particularly beneficial if you are recovering from a muscular injury. All of our Swim Spas come with installation and an 8 year limited warranty, leaving you to only worry about which model suits you best.</p>

<p>Quality tubs start at about $1,500, but depending on the added amenities, prices can climb as high as $5,000 or $6,000. Jacuzzi's Whisper technology features a patented pump mount system that absorbs half of the vibrations and cuts the tub's heating and pump systems sounds in half. You can spend some time with your loved ones in this stress-free environment where you can relax together and catch up. Trying to swim spas with your close family members or friends could be fun and a new experience that will help you get closer to each other.</p>
<p>A Jacuzzi is a large circular bath which is fitted with a device that makes the water move around. Our roll up Axis Cover System is a premium option that makes it easy for anyone to handle their swim spa cover. The Uniform Swimming Pool, Spa and Hot Tub Code is a model code developed by the International Association of Plumbing and Mechanical Officials ( IAPMO ) to govern the installation and inspection of plumbing systems associated with swimming pools, spas and hot tubs as a means of promoting the public's health, safety and welfare.</p>
<h3>About Our Hot Tubs Oliver Springs</h3>
<p>We consider the styles and sizes of swim spas each company makes as well as the number of spas available, the kinds of water jet propulsion systems used and price range. Our research shows PDC Spas is the best place to buy a swim spa because of its large selection, strong swim current systems, quick customer service and many fun options. Another important task is testing and adjusting the alkalinity of the water because if your water is hard, you'll end up having to replace swim spa parts.</p>
<p>Swim spas definitely are not cheap, but they are about half the price of a nice pool. In pools, you worry about turns, running into the wall, or jumping too deep that you hit the ground, swim spas erase these concerns and the possibility of these incidents. Jacuzzi is the company that brought hydrotherapy to the market more than 50 years ago with their hot tubs, and it is clear they are the leading experts in the industry.</p>
<p>By adding another Jet pump you benefit from the maximum therapy experience by adding jets around the body and under the legs. For example, a recent survey of Catalina swim spa reviews led me to discover that Catalina had just ended such a sale as I begin to write this piece, while investigating Michael Phelps swim spa options didn't turn up much of anything where special pricing was concerned. He designed a portable pump that could be fitted inside a bathtub to give the hydro-therapy.</p>

<p>And while a number of studies have touted the benefits of swimming over every other form of exercise (including jogging and walking!), and include swimming as a recommended form of exercise for everything from increasing the chances of conception in women to easing the suffering of those with Fibromyalgia, very few insurance plans offer any sort of coverage or assistance when making the purchase of a swimming spa.</p>
<p>Since inventing the whirlpool tub in 1956, Jacuzzi® brand products continue to set the standard for powerful performance, enduring quality and hassle-free operation. Not only do these high pressure jets massage the body, but they increase blood circulation and can be a form of subtle exercise. Check out our range of hot tubs, spa pools and swim spas, then get in touch and talk to our expert team about getting your spa dream underway.</p>
<p>Raised push buttons also make operating the light, air, and whirlpool systems extremely easy. In the late 1960s, Roy Jacuzzi, a third-generation Jacuzzi toyed with the idea of marketing the pump-fitted bath tub dubbed the 'Roman Bathtub' to cater for the growing need for leisure. When Swim Spas first came on the market about 10 years ago, they were priced in the $25,000 range. By having a smaller tub the volume of water is a lot less therefore running cost are reduced due to the heater having less water to heat.</p>
<p>Turn on the jets and the pulsating water massages the skin, increasing blood flow even more. No representative of Clearwater Spas, not its agents, distributors or dealers, has any authority to alter in any manner the terms of this Limited Warranty and Clearwater Spas is not responsible for any undertaking, representation of warranty made by any other person beyond those expressly set forth in this warranty.</p>
