<p>Due to their size, electric heating is the most efficient and regularly used to heat swim spas. It's Pool World's goal to provide you with the best hot tub for your lifestyle and budget. This spa from Essential Hot Tubs is very different from the rest because it's molded from premium-quality granite resin. Schulte said in her opinion, spas with paddlewheel water current systems create an experience that's truest to regular lap swimming.</p>
<p>Depending on how you use the Hot Tub and the people that actually use it you should fully drain and inspect your hot tub say every three to six months. The paddlewheel current allows people to swim side by side, and there's also an area of still water for people who prefer that. We have installed spa pools across Australia, from Canberra to Brisbane, to Melbourne, Sydney and Adelaide, and everywhere in between.</p>

Many dealerships now display Swim Spas in their stores.
