<p>When considering which model or Spa brand to buy the question has to be asked is it true that the number of Jets in a Hot Tub really matter or is it a question of how these Jets are designed to produce that ever so nice hydro massage effect that everybody enjoys so much. Traditionally the water in a hot tub is still, just like a swimming pool, and would only be circulated to heat filter it. Chlorine and disinfectants are used to maintain the hot tub. Pumps - Various pumps are used perhaps a separate circulation pump depending on the design of the Jacuzzi Hot Tub. To use vinegar to clean a hot tub, simply pour a one gallon jug of white vinegar into the tub and turn on the jets through one cycle.</p>
<p>Not to mention, most swim spas, especially the ones from Hydropool, come fully-equipped with a powerful jetting system. The proper use of hot tub covers will prevent accidental drowning and even some accidents such as an animal leaping into the spa and not being able to get out. Pool chlorine is a calcium based formula; hot tub chlorine is a sodium based formula.
