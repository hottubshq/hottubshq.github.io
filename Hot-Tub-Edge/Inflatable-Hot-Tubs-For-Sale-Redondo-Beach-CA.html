<p>Hot tub pumps keep the massage jets powered and also help keep the water clean by circulating the water. A big expensive of a hot tub is the time and cost of manufacturing the actual hot tub shell, many of these are make from acrylic and fibre glass, but there are now a new and much cheaper way of manufacturing a hot tub shell by using rotational moulding, this is a much quicker process and therefore being down the manufacturing costs of hot tubs, therefore manufactures can sell cheap hot tubs Even thought these hot tub are cheap they still using the same quality parts as the expensive manufactures put in there hot tubs.</p>
<p>Due to the fact that heat rises, it is the spa cover that contains this heat.

Before any piece of Jacuzzi® Pro Grade Pool Equipment leaves the factory, it is thoroughly tested in a state-of-the-art facility.

An H2X Fitness Swim Spa by Master Spas combines the benefits of water exercise with the therapy of a hot tub so you can own your wellness and win your day.</p>
<p>Swim spas give you the best environment to let go and focus on learning how to swim. These technologically advanced Swim Spas were developed with input from 23-time gold medalist Michael Phelps and his coach for training, swimming, fitness exercises. At the heart of our strategy is the reduced environmental impact of each of our hot tubs as it operates year after year in your backyard. Bio-film removal and preventing products remove build up in the extensive plumbing lines & jets of the swim spa leading to decreased chlorine use, cleaner filters, better "feel" & increased swimmer comfort.</p>

For all swim spas, be sure to maintain a chlorine level of about 1.0 - 2.0 ppm or if using bromine, 2.0 - 4.0 ppm. Meanwhile, the permanent hydrotherapy pools in the spas became known as spas or spa pools themselves just to make life a little more complicated.</p>

<p>Indoor tubs may produce some moisture when in use, particularly if the ambient room temperature is much less than the water inside the vessel (hot tub water temperatures range from 100-104 degrees F). Those planning an indoor installation need to think about how long they'll use it and perhaps consider installing an exhaust fan to pull moisture from the room. The water inside a swim spa can provide a much more comfortable and enjoyable environment for low-impact exercise.</p>
