The tub will have a wooden seat or bench running around the walls, so that it's easy for people to sit down and relax. Hydrotherapy is a treatment you can avail of in a hot tub for relaxation with the combination of heat, massage and buoyancy. For that reason, most people have no idea what a swim spa really costs.</p>
<p>Hot tubs produce extreme heat as well as high humidity so your hot tub needs to be placed in a well ventilated area of your home. The two main types of swim spas - single zone” swim spas with one large swim area, and dual zone” swim spas - with separate spa and swim areas to allow you to have a different temperature in your spa and pool.
