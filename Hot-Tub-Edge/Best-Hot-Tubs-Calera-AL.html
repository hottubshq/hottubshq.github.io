<p>As inviting and innocuous-looking as your Jacuzzi or hot tub may seem, using it for therapeutic purposes will require more precaution than you probably expect. Your hot tub will have jets and blowers, which can be switch on or off, depending on how you feel. Just like our large range of spas , our selection of swim spa options spans all budgets and specifications. In the 1940s hot tubs began to appear in the USA, inspired by the Japanese ofuro Hydrotherapy pumps were introduced by Jacuzzi Fiberglass shell hot tubs appeared around 1970 and were soon superseded by cast acrylic shells.</p>
<p>With the burgeoning interest in health and leisure across the United States, yet another opportunity was spotted in the 1960s, by Roy Jacuzzi, who invented and marketed the first self-contained, fully-integrated whirlpool bath, creating a whole new industry almost on his own. In short, hot tubs and Jacuzzis are not the same. Tests have proven that through having a heat pump within your spa pool or swim spa, running costs are reduced by over 50%, resulting in shortened and achievable payback period.</p>
<p>The warm water inside the tub can relax spasms, alleviate sprains, backache, and fatigue. This allow you to run your heat pump from your spa controller (not via a separate touchpad), use both heat pump AND electric heater for extra fast heating and extends the life of the heat pump. The heat eases out the tension built up in the muscles and increases the blood flow, which in turn heals the body. With 60 years of experience in manufacturing and a legacy of quality products, you can trust that Jacuzzi® understands quality and is focused on customer satisfaction.</p>

<p>By adding another Jet pump you benefit from the maximum therapy experience by adding jets around the body and under the legs.
