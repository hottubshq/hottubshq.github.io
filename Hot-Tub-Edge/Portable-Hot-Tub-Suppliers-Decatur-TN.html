I have to say that this does sound pretty appealing but my suspicion is that they aren't all that comfortable and I would miss the luxury of the moving water and hydrotherapy aspects of the modern hot tub.</p>
<p>Hot tubs are a wonderful excuse for getting out in the garden more often, and with care they can be designed to blend into their surroundings so they don't stick out as an eyesore. Because of this, all spas that use an ozone system should also include a mixing chamber that ensures ozone receives the correct contact time with the water.

<p>Enjoy the best of both worlds: a relaxing spa pool and water-based exercise swim spa in the comfort of your backyard. One of the top concerns when dealing with a Jacuzzi bathtub is the growth of bacteria and mold within the jets and tubing.

<p>With some minor reconstruction of the bathroom design, even older homes can take advantage of this concept bathtub to open up the room and give a more meditative soak. Infrared home saunas, however, create a sauna environment within a wooden box or even an open space while the heaters create the actual heating effect.
