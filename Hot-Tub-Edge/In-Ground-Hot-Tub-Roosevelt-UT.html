<p>There are various kinds of spas you can indulge in as per your requirements and convenience. The HL 630 Healthy Living model is one of the best-selling spas in the Healthy Living series. This acrylic hot tub is probably the closest thing you'll get to a real Jacuzzi in your garden. It caters for all of your relaxation, exercise & entertainment needs in one luxury swim spa. Think about the rules posted at public pools, including no running or diving, showering before and after swimming, and no peeing in the water.</p>
<p>This spinning wheel has indentations that move water through the pump and create the pressure in the pipes needed to keep water circulating and moving through the spa plumbing. Swim spas have one amazing addition that traditional swimming pools lack—the hydrotherapeutic experience. You can program a customized swimming experience to suit individual preferences, monitor your progress, and swim whenever you like in the comfort of your own home.</p>
<p>The J-575 Hot Tub is the next generation of backyard luxury, showcasing a unique curvilinear design and therapeutic lounge seat for full-body relaxation with more back and hip coverage. For a more challenging workout turn on the swim current and you will experience increased resistance against core, leg and upper body muscle groups. The whole essence of the spa is one of pampering and relaxation and most of the larger spas will have a suite of treatment rooms where you can have massages, facials and a wide range of body treatments.</p>

<p>Four pumps give this piece of equipment a lot of water flow, for therapy and exercise. Funny you should ask, because we happen to have a video that produced in 2008 at the Artesian Spas factory in Las Vegas, NV. The video is actually called "How Do They Build A Hot Tub Spa?", but the model that they are building in the video happens to be a large 16' Swim Spa. Unless you've specifically added additional coverage for your hot tub, any damages to it may not be covered by your regular policy.</p>
<p>However, you can turn the jets off and just soak, and many swim spas have an area designed just for that - essentially, there is a hot tub area in your spa. It also allows you to use your heat pump to cool the water in summer which is a very valuable benefit. Come and visit our showrooms where you can see our huge range of quality Spas and Swim Spas.
