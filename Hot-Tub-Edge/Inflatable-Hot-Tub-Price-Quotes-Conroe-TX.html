<p>Note: Our swim spas are fully plumbed and mechanically assembled, ready for use other than a couple of final connections at the site. But one exercise that never goes out of style is swimming. Swimming is exercise, and with any exercise we are losing moisture from the body - and it is important to replenish this moisture.
