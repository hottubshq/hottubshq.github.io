<p>Swim spas and spa pools (also known as portable spas or hot tubs) are very similar.

It was basic and even rudimentary, but from that moment on I have been obsessed with swim spas. The reason is air capacity is cut by approximately 75% during water exercise because of the water's pressure on your body.</p>

<p>The level of hydrotherapy that a spa can offer is based on the quality and function of the jets.
