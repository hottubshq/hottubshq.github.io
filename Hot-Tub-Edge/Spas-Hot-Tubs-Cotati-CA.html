The relaxation of a swim spa in unbelievable, you get the benefits of a hot tub and a fitness pool all in one. On the other hand, the harsh chemicals of the water can lead to dry, irritated skin if they aren't rinsed away when the whirlpool session is through.

Swim spas can be used for many types of exercise, beyond the invigorating workouts you get swimming against the resistance current.

Pumps - Various pumps are used perhaps a separate circulation pump depending on the design of the Jacuzzi Hot Tub. To use vinegar to clean a hot tub, simply pour a one gallon jug of white vinegar into the tub and turn on the jets through one cycle.</p>
<p>The reason most people opt for a swim spa is that they don't have enough room for a full-sized swimming pool.
