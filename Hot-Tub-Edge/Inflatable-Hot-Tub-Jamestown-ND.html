<p>In 1956 the Jacuzzi brothers invented the original hydrotherapy jet, today with 60 years' experience in hydrotherapy: Jacuzzi® is the brand when you are looking for a hot tub or bathroom products. Made with high tech rolling technology, this energy efficient cover is extremely easy to operate and it makes taking on and off your swim spa cover easier than ever. Natural swimming pools attempt to duplicate the environment of natural swimmable lakes which are healthy, non-polluted and ecologically-balanced bodies of water. Nowadays, the one-piece hot tubs are also quite common and have many advantages as well.</p>
<p>This is also how hot tubs take away stress. Hot tubs are unlike saunas, steam- and Turkish baths, which are steam only. You can easily assemble a swim spa together and use it as a portable swimming pool, wherever you go. Positioned to hit your shoulders and torso (jets that are too far apart or too low will not create the required resistance against the body and are a waste of water flow). Spas should also have a diverter valve to maintain water pressure on 1 or 2 seats.</p>
<p>This new and innovative way to take your swim spa cover on and off makes swim spa sessions easier than ever. Jacuzzi developed the first hot tub pump 60 years ago and continues to provide innovative hydrotherapy products and features. For the ultimate in relaxation, a whirlpool bath is absolutely ideal for easing muscle tension & improving blood circulation, and now it's even easier to upgrade than ever.

Our Swim Spa Suite is the perfect option, as it offers the best physical therapy and romantic therapy all wrapped up in one economical spa package.

<p>They gave me a great price on the hot tub and the entire experience was great. Besides hydromassage, there are hot tubs with chromotherapy that, thanks to underwater lights, emit rays of colored lights able to infuse energy and balance while ameliorating the mood. From jet placement to optimal positioning of the body in ergonomic seats, a JACUZZI® Hot Tub is a showcase in quality design. They soon created a tub with a built-in jet whirlpool, which took off in popularity.</p>
