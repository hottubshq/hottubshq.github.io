<p>OK, class ~ it's time to define the true meaning of the different types of hot water therapy. It has the new River Jet swim system with Viper pumps, and plenty of water features. Whisper-quiet motors, colorful lighting, dancing air bubbles, powerful jets — your bath is an expression of yourself and an extension of how you want to feel. Most indoor kinds hold one or two people simply because the available space is limited to the standard size bathroom.

Due to the hot, damp environment that occurs around a swim spa, even the hardiest of timbers will be susceptible to mold and mildew. You do not drain the water from a hot tub after each use. Jacuzzi tub brings the health benifits too. Swim spas provide space for kids to move around.
