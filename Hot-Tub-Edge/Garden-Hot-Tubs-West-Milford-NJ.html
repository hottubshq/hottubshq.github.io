Whether you choose an inground or above ground swim spa, the safety regulations are the same as they would be for a full-sized swimming pool. We offer only hot tubs made from western red cedar (Thuja Plicata). Testing a water sample weekly and adding the right chemicals to get the correct levels is essential to maintaining your swim spa.</p>

Yes, our swim spas come is a variety of sizes. When purchasing your spa pool, we urge you to ensure the spas shell construction follows the above details. The first time I encountered a hot tub was when I was house-hunting with my wife. In 1968, Jacuzzi incorporated the hydrotherapy pump into the inside walls of its tubs, which created the first ever self-contained whirlpool.</p>
<p>The idea is that you swim in the tub and the current produced by the swim spa pushes against you in much the same way as a treadmill. Putting one on the second floor is not a good idea, unless it is a small bathtub Jacuzzi. Our insulation system harnesses all the heat from the pumps and the heater inside the spa cabinet while reflecting the colder outside air away from the spa. This is why we make Royal Spa Swim Spas from components that can be found at most pool and spa supply stores.</p>

<p>Coast Spas Hot Tubs and Swim Spas are optimized for superior Wellness. In this article, we're going to take a closer look at the many benefits of Hydropool Swim Spas. If space is no problem, you may want to consider a larger unit like the one to the left (16' or larger) that has two separate sections molded into it. Realize that these style units may be a bit more costly because they need two completely separate filtering, pumping and heating systems.</p>
<p>Now, this was fine for a number of years until, of course, spas started springing up in hotels and sports complexes and going to the spa” (yah!) just like the Romans did became cool again. Go for a more powerful spa pump if you have a bigger jacuzzi or the pressure of water in your area is relatively lower. After hitting the slopes in Irownwood, use your hot tub to aid in repairing sore muscles and injuries. Hotel Spas - These are the same as the above the only difference would be it may come in with your all inclusive package where you would get unlimited treatment, drinks and food.</p>

<p>Smaller 2 person spas normally need more frequent water changes than larger 8 person spas (except if 8 people are using the spa more than twice a week!). A primary reason people buy swim spas is to swim laps without needing a big pool.
