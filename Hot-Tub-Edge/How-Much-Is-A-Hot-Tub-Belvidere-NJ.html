<p>Interior design is about creating a harmonious space to live in, about creating exciting and functional environments in your home. Sure, if your bathroom is too small for a hot tub, or any tub for that matter, you could always choose a massage shower. Install fencing or invest in a sturdy cover that kids can't fall though, even if they step on it. Also, pull up or remove ladders from above-ground models when not in use to prevent children from climbing into the pool or hot tub. An H2X Fitness Swim Spa allows you to exercise, relax, and entertain in the convenience and privacy of your backyard, year-round.</p>
<p>All our Hot Tubs include standard delivery and installation to your base and power supply, as well as including a cover, chemical starter kit and two tier steps. Yes, our swim spas come is a variety of sizes. When purchasing your spa pool, we urge you to ensure the spas shell construction follows the above details. The first time I encountered a hot tub was when I was house-hunting with my wife. In 1968, Jacuzzi incorporated the hydrotherapy pump into the inside walls of its tubs, which created the first ever self-contained whirlpool.</p>
<p>The jet system commonly installed in a whirlpool tub, hot tub, or outdoor spa provides a massaging motion that targets the muscle groups in the body. Hot tub pump replacements, parts, impellers, wet ends and seals can be ordered online with quick shipping in order to complete a repair and get the spa working properly again. Swim spas with poor purification systems will require extra money (and time) spent on chemicals.</p>

<p>This can range from large, spa pools which you might find in a leisure centre or health club, to private whirlpool baths for domestic properties. Now the price of a Swim Spa seems very reasonable when compared to a $16,000 hot tub or a $40,000 inground pool. For all swim spas, be sure to maintain a chlorine level of about 1.0 - 2.0 ppm or if using bromine, 2.0 - 4.0 ppm. Meanwhile, the permanent hydrotherapy pools in the spas became known as spas or spa pools themselves just to make life a little more complicated.</p>
