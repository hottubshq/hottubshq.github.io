Swim spas are not an ideal choice for families, as only one person can comfortably swim in a swim spa at any time.

<p>As its name suggests, a swim spa pool is basically a cross between a spa and a swimming pool. But even with limited space, a larger swim spa is still much smaller than a full pool while providing a comfortable experience for a decent number of people. When most people go to buy the spas, the first question they have in mind is the cost and the second question is about the power consumption. Swim Spas actually cost a bit more than a portable hot tub spa and a lot less than an inground swimming pool.</p>
<p>Each of our specially-designed family of hot tubs offers its own unique look, feel and features so you can find the right fit for you and your entire family. As with hot tubs, start your sauna search by identifying how many people will be using it at one time.

<p>By choosing a swim spa, you can swim without doing laps in a regular sized pool. Hot tubs can replace what used to happen nightly at the dinner table. The benefits of using jetted bathtubs should never be underestimated. Swim spas would waste a single penny of yours.
