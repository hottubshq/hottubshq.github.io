<p>The internet is now an ideal place to find companies that are able to offer you competently priced hot tubs due to their overheads being a lot less as many of them do not have showrooms. This inflatable hot tub is easy to set up with a clear instructional DVD and this particular model is loved by customers for its atmospheric multi-coloured lighting, which makes it the ideal place to wind down in the evenings. Deluxe 7-person hot tub with 20 hydrotherapy massage jets and a full body lounge.

Our insulation system harnesses all the heat from the pumps and the heater inside the spa cabinet while reflecting the colder outside air away from the spa. This is why we make Royal Spa Swim Spas from components that can be found at most pool and spa supply stores.</p>
