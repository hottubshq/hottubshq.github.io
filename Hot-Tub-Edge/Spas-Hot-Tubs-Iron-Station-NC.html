<p>Hot tubs and spas are becoming increasingly more popular and they are to be found in many homes. According to Wikipedia : a Hot Tub is a large tub or small pool full of heated water and used for hydrotherapy or pleasure. Add warmth and water movement and hot tubbing becomes the stuff of lifetime memories. If you do use a hot tub, turn down the temperature and limit your time in the water to less than 10 minutes. A Spa system will use air to push the water around your bath and create that bubble and whirl effects.</p>
<p>The Swim Collection is available in a Pool, Play, Performance, Wellness Spa® and Wellness Spa®X Series. EBay, the king of online auctions, typically has dozens of hot tub auctions running at any one time. It is a known fact that warm water helps not only to reduce stress, but also to ease sore muscles and aches. Completely adjustable current means everyone who uses the swim spa will find the perfect swimming speed.</p>
<p>A spa or hot tub should be shocked with the appropriate sanitizer after use. Hot tub water chemicals, especially chlorine have a specific formula that lasts in hot water won't turn the water cloudy and has the right pH for hot tubbing. When spas are created with less than 4 layers it will be made evident through the shorter warranties that accompany the spa pool as its lifespan will be dramatically shortened.</p>

<p>Don't forget that apart from the initial purchase expense, there will be monthly expenses for maintaining Jacuzzi tubs Those expenses will be the electricity to keep the water at the right temperature, chemicals to keep the ph levels safe and water to keep it at the right level.

I had been swimming regularly at a public pool and found it crowded and chemically distasteful.</p>
