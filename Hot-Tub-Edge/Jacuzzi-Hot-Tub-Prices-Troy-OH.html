<p>The hot tub is an attractive and strong focal point when added as a new feature in a home. The Indulgence swim spa is the top of the line for us at Sunbelt Spas. Although ABS based acrylic has proven strength, fibreglass is still sometimes added in order to ensure it maintains its strength alongside supporting the spas water and bather load. When your bathroom space is limited, a corner tub can give you the most out of the space. The next big leap forward came when the Jacuzzi brothers hydrotherapy pump was combined with fibreglass bodywork, a filtration system and electric heating system to create what is essentially the modern day hot tub.</p>
<p>Outdoor hot tubs also come in a variety of styles but are generally either a round or octagon shape. Most of these accidents happened at a pool or hot tub at the child's own home. At almost six metres in length and two and a half metres in width, the AquaSport 19 DTfX acts as a swimming pool, hot tub and aquafit centre all in a single unit. Unfortunately, there are a number of cons that come with having even a small Jacuzzi bathtub installed.</p>
<p>You can also find models that feature stunning LED light displays, gorgeous water features, touchscreen control panel, MOTO Massage Jets (the only full-back rotating jets in the entire hot tub market), Bluetooth compatible speaker systems, visual entertainment systems and so much more. At Vortex Spas you get cutting edge spa design and high quality, factory direct. Falcon Pools provides you with the ultimate experience of relaxation by installing a Jacuzzi in your home or alongside your pool.</p>

<p>Finally, if you live in an area, which has hard water, then you will need to add an anti-scaling chemical to stop the build-up of calcium deposits on the sides and floor of your hot tub.

Designed to improve your lifestyle and offer a better way of taking care of yourself, Jacuzzi® hot tubs are the most complete and versatile synthesis of shared well-being.</p>
