Don't be fooled by the black-and-white color scheme of this hot tub - it's the gold standard of acrylic hot tubs from the experts at Canadian Spa.

Swim spas as typically smaller than lap pools, but offer varied jet speeds and intensity for a customized swim workout that changes as skills improve.</p>
<p>Water constantly passes over the steel tube creating a consistent and reliable heating pattern. One of the greater benefits that comes with a swim spa is in the form of efficiency and portability.

This company has five lines of swim spas: AquaPlay, AquaTrainer, ExecutiveTrainer, AquaSport and ExecutiveSport.</p>
<p>Buying a used spa is another way of acquiring a hot tub without paying full price. If the swim spas are not cleaned or maintained from time to time, you will not enjoy the swimming experience due to the dirt collected and the bad odor emitted from the swim spa. One of the most overlooked areas in an all season pool is the ability of the unit to provide benefits outside the swim and massage. These are common pressure areas and jetted bathtubs know how to attack what ails you.</p>
<p>This rules out family swimming sessions and water games. These covers come in 6 colors, are designed to fit most Swim Spas, and are durable and long lasting. The calcium can also build up on the sensors of the Hot Tub that regulate and deal with temperature and water flow, which can cause problems later.
