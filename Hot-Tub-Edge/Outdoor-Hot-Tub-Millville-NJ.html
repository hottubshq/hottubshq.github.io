<p>A lot of people ask what is the difference between a swim spa and a swimming pool? When you install your hot tub or pool you may or may not have used conduit or a duct that is buried in your garden for protecting the cables, if there is spare capacity, you can feed your power and cable leads through the duct to the location normally on a wall near the pool or hot tub. While some spas still use wooden tubs, there are many private spas that use specially designed hot tubs and whirlpools to create a relaxing atmosphere for their clients while still using the healing power of warm water.</p>
<p>In general, swim spas tend to cost more than hot tubs of comparable size, although that varies depending on such things as the number of jets and other amenities. Some love the flexibility that a swim spa provides, while others are after the many features they offer. If you want to feel relaxed by pleasuring in the warm waters after an entire day of work, then you should install Jacuzzi in your bathroom to feel completely relaxed.</p>
<p>After all, Endless Pools pioneered propeller-driven swim-in-place technology in 1988 and has remained the industry-leader for nearly 30 years. When asked What is the largest swim spa?” we tell customers that Hydropool has two of the largest swim spas available on the market. The photo to the left shows the swimming end of the Swim Spa. Just be sure that you can access any of the hot tub workings that you may need to at any time.</p>

<p>A question we see often is, "How much do swim spas cost?"

Some hot tubs can be as hot as 40C, so it's best to avoid them. But the first thing to consider when choosing your hot tubs would be the location.
