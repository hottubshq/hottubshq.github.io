If you do buy a second hot tub you will not of course have the many advantages that come with buying a new unit but you should perhaps ask for a limited guarantee from the vendor and if buying from a second hand dealer in Hot Tubs then you certainly in my view should get a limited guarantee of some kind.</p>
