<p>The hot tub is an attractive and strong focal point when added as a new feature in a home. One stays cool for swimming, and the other stays hot for hot tubbing. For this reason, Vortex Spas use a 4 layer, 8 step Thermabond lamination process not found in most swim spas. Most people see improvement in their symptoms when they simply stop going in hot tubs, but some people may need treatment with corticosteroids or antibiotics, according to a 2006 study from the Mayo Clinic. On Endless Pools' website, you can build your own swim spa and see a price quote right away, making it the only company we evaluated that posts all prices up front.</p>
<p>As its name suggests, a swim spa pool is basically a cross between a spa and a swimming pool. But even with limited space, a larger swim spa is still much smaller than a full pool while providing a comfortable experience for a decent number of people. When most people go to buy the spas, the first question they have in mind is the cost and the second question is about the power consumption. Swim Spas actually cost a bit more than a portable hot tub spa and a lot less than an inground swimming pool.</p>
<p>The J-575 Hot Tub is the next generation of backyard luxury, showcasing a unique curvilinear design and therapeutic lounge seat for full-body relaxation with more back and hip coverage. For a more challenging workout turn on the swim current and you will experience increased resistance against core, leg and upper body muscle groups. The whole essence of the spa is one of pampering and relaxation and most of the larger spas will have a suite of treatment rooms where you can have massages, facials and a wide range of body treatments.</p>

The features usually include illumination, jets ergonomic seating, control panels, and the dual-zone for heating to offer a dual experience of the hot tub to relax and another zone of the swim section for workouts.</p>
