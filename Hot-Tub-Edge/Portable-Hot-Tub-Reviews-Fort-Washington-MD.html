<p>You will find that there are many manufacturers of bath tubs on the market today but only one name really stands above the rest. Jacuzzi Water Villas are water bungalows in the Maldives, located over-the-water, in the lagoon… a short walk along your private jetty to this secluded hideaway featuring a larger bedroom, wood floor, espresso machine, a spacious bathroom, a private walled-in outdoor area featuring a Jacuzzi for two under the stars”, a wooden sundeck with chaise lounges, a shaded area, tropical plants, a private sundeck with stairs into the sea and the most magnificent views of all.</p>
<p>With the burgeoning interest in health and leisure across the United States, yet another opportunity was spotted in the 1960s, by Roy Jacuzzi, who invented and marketed the first self-contained, fully-integrated whirlpool bath, creating a whole new industry almost on his own. In short, hot tubs and Jacuzzis are not the same. Tests have proven that through having a heat pump within your spa pool or swim spa, running costs are reduced by over 50%, resulting in shortened and achievable payback period.</p>
