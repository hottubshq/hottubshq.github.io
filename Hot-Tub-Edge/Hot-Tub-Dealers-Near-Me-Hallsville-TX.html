<p>A guy named Dr. Stephen Blair (University of South Carolina) conducted an extended survey to study the effectiveness of swimming for fitness. All swim spa covers are made specifically to fit your Master Spas swim spa and come 6" thick in the middle and taper off to 4". This cover includes an energy efficient 1.5 lb foam density and a 24 R-value, with a full length heat seal and upgraded rubber grip handles (included!). We had limited space and the swim spa allowed us to maximise the use of our garden and has proven to be far more economical than a pool.</p>
<p>Water constantly passes over the steel tube creating a consistent and reliable heating pattern. One of the greater benefits that comes with a swim spa is in the form of efficiency and portability. Hotel Alfonska offers for guests not only accommodation and meals, but the tennis courts or whirlpool for 4 persons too. Many swim spas also offer the option of swim jets in addition to the hydrotherapy jets. Baths, swimming pools, jacuzzi are turned off 10 minutes to closing of the Aqua Park.</p>
<p>Just like hot tub spas, most Swim Spas are molded out of acrylic and are typically 12′ - 24′ in length. The unique shell design of the MP line of swim spas gives you a long and wide swim area with no hidden obstacles like benches or steps to hit your feet. Avoid hot tubs if you can during those 9 months. If you are looking for a free-standing pool with heated water, hydrotherapy jets, filtration system and one that is semi-permanent then a hot tub is what you need.</p>

I had been swimming regularly at a public pool and found it crowded and chemically distasteful.</p>
