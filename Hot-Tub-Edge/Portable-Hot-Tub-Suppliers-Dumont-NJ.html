<p>Did you know that a swimming pool is not only fun to swim and relax in? Aside from the consideration of a spa's heat pump, the insulation within a spa pool determines how much output energy is required to maintain it. There are three main insulation systems used today, it is dependable on the company, manufacturer and model as to which one is adopted. The TruSwim® unique dual propulsion design guarantees an incomparable aquatic fitness experience with endless possibilities. We have been researching, ranking and reviewing swim spas for more than four years.</p>
<p>The most prominent safety feature walk-in tubs bring to the table — the door — also has a downside because you can't fill the tub with water before entering it, which could leave you a bit chilled. Hot tubs offer rest and relaxation. Swim spas are perfect for anyone who is looking for a healthy, low-impact way to exercise on a daily basis. And just like its namesake, great performance is exactly what you'll experience with the Michael Phelps Legend Series hot tub.</p>
<p>Drink water while in the hot tub to cool off your body. We also have many videos right here on our web site where you can see Swim Spas in action, right from your own computer screen.

<h3>About Our Hot Tubs Dumont</h3>
<p>The most difficult part about an inflatable hot tub is the inflation of it - and that's not too difficult or time consuming with an air pump. With several sizes to choose from, an Endless Pools Swim Spa can fit virtually anywhere. Clearwater Spas cover lift makes it easier to remove your hot tub hardcover. So, my best advice, is that one should only buy a product that is well built by an American or Western internationally recognized producer of Hot Tubs and then there is every chance that the product will last and last and give very many years of faultless performance.</p>
<p>This inflatable hot tub is easy to set up with a clear instructional DVD and this particular model is loved by customers for its atmospheric multi-coloured lighting, which makes it the ideal place to wind down in the evenings. Deluxe 7-person hot tub with 20 hydrotherapy massage jets and a full body lounge. With technological advancement, sauna setups have come a long way from rooms in which water was splashed on hot rocks to produce steam.</p>
<p>Look for swim spas that are insulated to keep in the heat and pumps and motors that are rated more energy efficient. When you get the hot tubs, the first thing you need to do it to read the installation manual very carefully. Obviously spa pools are wet areas. The self-cleaning swim spas clean 100% of the water in the unit in just 45 minutes, so you can spend more time enjoying your swim spa.
