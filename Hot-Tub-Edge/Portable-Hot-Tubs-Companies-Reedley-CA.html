You want to be in your tub, not taking a bunch of time to maintain it. That's why Rich's has carried Leisure Time, the premier name in hot tub water care for over twenty-five years.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, we get calls all the time from people who bought from one of these traveling hot tub shows complaining that they can't get help.

In fact, even man's best friend, his dog, can benefit from quality time spent in a swimming pool and spa.

<p>Jacuzzi is simply a brand name of hot tub. Deluxe 6-person hot tub with 40 hydrotherapy massage jets and a full body lounge. Swim spa: This is a small pool that uses powerful jets to propel water toward you so you can get a workout by swimming against the tide, so to speak.

There's small hot tubs are ideal for people that wish to have a hot tub, but do not want a huge hot tub due to them not having room in the garden or just feel they do not have the need for a larger hot tub, as only every 2 people will be using the hot tub.</p>
<p>In most cases, these swim spas cost less an $2.00 a day to operate. If you ever had a chance to relax in a Jacuzzi tub, you must know what it can do to help your mind and body. Of course, the Endless Pools Fitness System is so much more than a swim spa. After an active day on the slopes, it is worth relaxing at the hotel's wellness centre with an indoor swimming pool, Jacuzzi and sauna.

<p>You are probably thinking, Yeah, this sounds great, but it probably costs like a trillion dollars.” That is a common misconception about Swim Spas…that they are only for the fabulously wealthy. Illumatherapy also offers four points of entry, with two on each side of the tub, and air bubbles spraying from the jets give the appearance of dancing as they reflect the light. The blowers make the hot tub feel like you've got your own personal geyser - forcing air from the bottom of the pool, and creating a very relaxing environment for you.</p>
