<p>Hot tubs are a great way to relax after a long day at work. If you want an inground swim spa installed, you can expect to pay more than these prices, as there is so much extra work involved in installing any pool inground. In many areas you can also commission hot tubs and install wooden swimming pools. Quarrycast is a mineral crystal composite, a new material developed by Victoria & Albert Baths, to enhance your bathing experience: it's warm to the touch, keeping the water in your hot tub hot for a long time; it has a naturally high gloss finish and it can be colored with the dye of your choice, maximizing the interior design options in your bathroom.</p>
<p>Swimlife is in the swimspa business for life and the only way to ensure success is to produce, offer and innovate the highest quality swimspas possible. Also, swim spas require a metal frame for support (which does not like being underground) and have the equipment (which requires access) inside the cabinet. Above ground hot tubs are freestanding basins that can be positioned anywhere, provided that there is connection to electric energy.</p>
<p>You can also find models that feature stunning LED light displays, gorgeous water features, touchscreen control panel, MOTO Massage Jets (the only full-back rotating jets in the entire hot tub market), Bluetooth compatible speaker systems, visual entertainment systems and so much more. At Vortex Spas you get cutting edge spa design and high quality, factory direct. Falcon Pools provides you with the ultimate experience of relaxation by installing a Jacuzzi in your home or alongside your pool.</p>

One major thing to remember and definitely not overlook is how much space you have to fit your hot tub into.</p>
<p>The reason most people opt for a swim spa is that they don't have enough room for a full-sized swimming pool.

And if you're interested in swimming laps without installing a massive pool, swim spas are a great alternative.
