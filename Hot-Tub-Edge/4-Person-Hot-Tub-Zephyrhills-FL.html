<p>Indoor tubs may produce some moisture when in use, particularly if the ambient room temperature is much less than the water inside the vessel (hot tub water temperatures range from 100-104 degrees F).

The water inside a swim spa can provide a much more comfortable and enjoyable environment for low-impact exercise.</p>
<p>You even hear stories of people that buy cheap eastern hot tubs and they do not get the cover for the hot tub till months later.

In the late 1960s, Roy Jacuzzi, a third-generation Jacuzzi toyed with the idea of marketing the pump-fitted bath tub dubbed the 'Roman Bathtub' to cater for the growing need for leisure. When Swim Spas first came on the market about 10 years ago, they were priced in the $25,000 range. By having a smaller tub the volume of water is a lot less therefore running cost are reduced due to the heater having less water to heat.</p>
<p>Swimming pools used for competitions are usually found indoors and heated to allow usage anytime of the year and to more easily fulfill with the regulations regarding temperature, lighting, and equipment.
