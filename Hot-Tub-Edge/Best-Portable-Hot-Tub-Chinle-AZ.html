<p>While it is rather unfortunate, from time to time your hot tub may have a leak in it. Thankfully, there are some easy methods that you can implement that allow you to locate the leak and have it fixed. If you've yet to explore the incredible benefits of swim spas, here's your chance. You may not think of a spa as life-changing, but Clarity Spas aren't just any hot tub. Thus, you can consider swimming at the beach instead of swimming in a swimming pool. 6. Number of jets versus number of pumps-Your average spa water pump should support a maximum of 30 jets. The setup is easy enough on this one, but heating the tub is slow going.</p>
<p>It can be difficult to carve out the time you need to focus on your fitness, health, and family. The modular design also allows for pools of varying sizes from 7′ x 12′ to 10′ x 16′ with water depths up to 6′ deep. The idea behind the Jacuzzi tub is to bring the great features of an outdoor hot tub inside. Jacuzzi® J-400 hot tubs come in a variety of configurations including smaller 2-3 person tubs and a large 8-9 person hot tub.</p>
<p>The new Coleman SaluSpa Inflatable AirJet Hot Tub bucks the trend of circular hot tubs in favor of a more square-shaped design, but it's able to provide 114 air jets to pamper you in relaxing heated water, up the the 104 degree maximum temperature.

For all swim spas, be sure to maintain a chlorine level of about 1.0 - 2.0 ppm or if using bromine, 2.0 - 4.0 ppm. Meanwhile, the permanent hydrotherapy pools in the spas became known as spas or spa pools themselves just to make life a little more complicated.</p>

Swim, exercise and relax with friends and family from the comforts and convenience of home. With multiple pumps you also get more and stronger massage jets as you can divert the water from the swim jets to the massage seats when you are not swimming.</p>
<p>A hot tub used to be seen as a luxury item that people could only dream of owning one day. But endless swimming is just the beginning, because modern swim spas offer powerful hydro - massaging jets for complete rejuvenation and relaxation after a hard workout or anytime the mood strikes.

In tune with advanced market developments, we are providing Bathtub Repair Service. Some walk-in tubs feature heated seats to help the bather stay warm while waiting for the tub to fill and drain. If you are buying the swim spa for a family-type, year-round pool, you might not worry too much about having a strong current.</p>
<p>Many have what is known as thermal” spa facilities which basically means that there will be hydrotherapy pools, possibly steam rooms, ice caves, salt steam rooms, feature showers and maybe saunas at different temperatures. However, larger swim spas have dual-zone” heating; the primary section for the workouts is cold, while the second one for relaxing is hot. The time-tested performance, attractive appearance and obvious quality is apparent to everyone desiring a no-hassle cover lift.</p>
