In addition, some manufacturers offer pools with an easy-to-clean Gelcoat surface that helps minimize algae build up and creates a barrier against moisture absorption.</p>
<p>Over the past 2 years we've been helping customers with swim spas determine the best care program for their individual needs and addressing their individual concerns. The length of your swim spa area should be the height of the tallest swimmer in your household with their arms outstretched plus around a metre so you don't touch the jets or kick the seats while swimming. The health benefits from increased circulation and such that you get from the water jets you do not get with an air jetted bathtub.</p>
<h3>Jacuzzi Hot Tubs Sensors & Switches Kathleen</h3>
