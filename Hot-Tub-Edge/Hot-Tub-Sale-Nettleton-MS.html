<p>When you are looking for good swim spas, don't forget to have a look at the H2X. While budget swim spas promise a lesser financial burden initially, much more can go wrong if inferior materials and unskilled labor are used. In fact, some swim spas offer more versatility than large pools. In almost all cases the pumps and pipework are all contained under the bath so space shouldn't be a problem unless you're looking for a larger bath. Our friendly staff members are extremely knowledgeable about all variations of Australian swim spas, plunge pools and hot tubs for sale at competitive prices.</p>

<p>The areas around the pump and tubes need clearance as well in case any repairs are needed down the line. If the pH level becomes too low, the water will become acidic, irritating the skin of swimmers and causing corrosive damage to your spa or pool. All Jacuzzi® Hot Tubs have a five stage filtration and ClearRay bulb, ensuring your water is quickly and easily cleared of all debris ready for use.
