<p>Deluxe 4-person hot tub with 40 hydrotherapy massage jets and a full body lounge. Jets - Some Hydro Massage Jets would be a very good idea to introduce the water into the Hot Tub and here I would suggest not those simple bullet hole type that are un adjustable and are merely copied from decades ago but those that are fully adjustable.
