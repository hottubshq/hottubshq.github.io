<p>Professional athletes usually have access to the latest techniques and methods of healing the stress and strains that are put on their bodies from the sports that they play. Thanks to the MP line, you can enjoy full-body effects of aquatic exercise with time saving convenience in the privacy of your own home. A backlit buoyancy jet helps maintain ideal swimming position while stabilizing hip jets ensures the swimmer remains centered in the swim lane. Although, hot tubs and spas are convenient to use, they have a shortcoming associated with them also. If your hot tub pump seal is leaking, you will need to find the correct seal kit.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, we get calls all the time from people who bought from one of these traveling hot tub shows complaining that they can't get help. This is why most people have their swim spa above ground and consider building steps or a deck around it if they want a more landscaped look. In fact, even man's best friend, his dog, can benefit from quality time spent in a swimming pool and spa. Lidos, ocean pools, in Australia were created by enclosing a section of the rock shelf where water circulates through the pools or by constant flooding over the side of the pool during high tide.</p>
<p>Swim spas can often be used like regular hot tubs. The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG) states that becoming overheated in a hot tub is not recommended during pregnancy. If a swim spa isn't quite what you're looking for, there are a wide range of alternatives to swim spas in Australia. When it comes to setting standards for swim spa covers, the Smartop Vanish Swim Spa Cover (XTST113) sets the bar high.</p>

Our most compact swim spa, the X200 combines our new jetted swim current with the mental and physical health benefits of hydromassage. Due to the wiring of many spas not being capable of supporting a large pump as well as the heater at the same time, a ‘load shed' setting is adopted or the heater is simply turns off completely while the spa is in use.</p>
