<p>A lot of people ask what is the difference between a swim spa and a swimming pool? When you install your hot tub or pool you may or may not have used conduit or a duct that is buried in your garden for protecting the cables, if there is spare capacity, you can feed your power and cable leads through the duct to the location normally on a wall near the pool or hot tub. While some spas still use wooden tubs, there are many private spas that use specially designed hot tubs and whirlpools to create a relaxing atmosphere for their clients while still using the healing power of warm water.</p>

<h3>About Our Hot Tubs Destrehan</h3>
<p>Another advantage of portable hot tubs are they can be looked after much better, lets just say that you were having a terrible winter, with a normal hot tub you would only be able to cover the tub which would ultimately still lead to wear and tear throughout the year.

Also, pull up or remove ladders from above-ground models when not in use to prevent children from climbing into the pool or hot tub.
