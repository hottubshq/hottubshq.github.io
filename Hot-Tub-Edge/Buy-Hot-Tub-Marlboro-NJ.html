<p>Once upon a time the average American family would gather nightly around the table to share dinner and swap stories from their hectic days. The J-335IP, hot tub has an FX10 Therapy seat to fit every contour of the body and features 40 PowerPro® jets which deliver an effective hydromassage across the entire body with jets to target key areas including shoulders, wrists and feet. There is a swimming spa intended for toddlers or children. On a weekly basis, you should consider adding an anti-foaming agent to your hot tub's water. The benefits of hydrotherapy, whether in a swimming pool, or in a spa, are wide-spread.</p>
<p>The reason most people opt for a swim spa is that they don't have enough room for a full-sized swimming pool. The swimming part of a swim spa is what makes it uniquely different than a hot tub alone, however. Always make certain the spa's control system accommodates the heat pump. And if you're interested in swimming laps without installing a massive pool, swim spas are a great alternative. As we evaluated them, we considered their current systems and the types of jets they offer as well as their customer service, selection, prices and accessories.</p>
<p>Relaxing in a warm jetted hot tub is very relaxing and good for your mental health. Ensure you have plenty of space to fit the hot tub, as well as easy access to the power source and enough room to safely get in and out of the hot tub. Hydropool has swim spas for relaxing, working out and even a little bit of both. Vortex Spas feature advanced water treatment technologies that work together in tandem with a light chemical boost to keep your water crystal clear and healthy.</p>

Cheaper spas sometimes reduce the size of the unit to make up for these cuts.</p>
<p>The maintenance of the spa is of great concern to all the owners of swim spas. Known for innovation, Jacuzzi is the company that started the modern hot tub industry. Many people do not realize how dangerous it can be to ignore this crucial swimming gear. Even if you don't have a regular recreational pool, make sure there isn't anything enticing left around your swim spa or hot tub. The best thing about a Swim Spa is that it eliminates the need for a full-sized swimming pool and a spa and thus cuts back on the amount of space needed.</p>

<p>You are probably thinking, Yeah, this sounds great, but it probably costs like a trillion dollars.” That is a common misconception about Swim Spas…that they are only for the fabulously wealthy. Illumatherapy also offers four points of entry, with two on each side of the tub, and air bubbles spraying from the jets give the appearance of dancing as they reflect the light. The blowers make the hot tub feel like you've got your own personal geyser - forcing air from the bottom of the pool, and creating a very relaxing environment for you.</p>
