<p>Swimming accessories are important for summer safety if you plan on swimming. With Jacuzzi for Life, you have the option of purchasing any 300, 400, 500 or LX series hot tub. Innovative jet pump & equipment technology and newer manufacturing methods made the cost of production of the Swim Spa to come down to the levels of a high quality portable hot tub. The biggest factor to consider in terms of cost is the price of the Jacuzzi bathtub itself. Many people ask themselves if it's worth it to invest in a swim spa.</p>
<p>Swim spas definitely are not cheap, but they are about half the price of a nice pool. In pools, you worry about turns, running into the wall, or jumping too deep that you hit the ground, swim spas erase these concerns and the possibility of these incidents. Jacuzzi is the company that brought hydrotherapy to the market more than 50 years ago with their hot tubs, and it is clear they are the leading experts in the industry.</p>
<p>You can have self-contained and portable” unit, you can just get a Swim Spa shell and set it into a deck, you can have a customized Swim spa made for you or you can get a Swim Spa Water Jet and install it into your existing above ground or inground swimming pool. While their selection may appear limited compared to our picks for the best walk-in tub brands , it's easier to narrow down your choices from a few solid American-made tubs with various therapeutic benefits.</p>

<h3>About Our Hot Tubs Bunker Hill</h3>
<p>When replacing or repairing a hot tub pump, it is always a good idea to make sure the existing pump cord is free from nicks or even shorts and that the ends are not corroded. There are usually a couple of different water circuits, with one heating and filtering the water, the other operating the hydrotherapy jets. Some hot tubs on the market may contain air injectors. Stepping into your Jacuzzi® hot tub in your garden allows you to sit back, relax and enjoy the view whilst enjoying a warm and relaxing spa experience at home.</p>
<p>You are probably thinking, Yeah, this sounds great, but it probably costs like a trillion dollars.” That is a common misconception about Swim Spas…that they are only for the fabulously wealthy. Illumatherapy also offers four points of entry, with two on each side of the tub, and air bubbles spraying from the jets give the appearance of dancing as they reflect the light. The blowers make the hot tub feel like you've got your own personal geyser - forcing air from the bottom of the pool, and creating a very relaxing environment for you.</p>
<p>This smart design, combined with an R-value of 20 and a one-pound foam density, makes our Swim Spa Michael Phelps cover a great option for cold-weather climates. There are both indoor and outdoor versions of hot tubs. Designed for performance, not to mention your well being, the revolutionary current-generator in the E-Series is the ultimate in swim spa technology. For the first time ever, an infinity (or vanishing) edge is available in a portable full-size Swim Spa.</p>
