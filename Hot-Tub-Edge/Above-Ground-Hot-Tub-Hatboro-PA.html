<p>The hot tub is an attractive and strong focal point when added as a new feature in a home. The Indulgence swim spa is the top of the line for us at Sunbelt Spas. Although ABS based acrylic has proven strength, fibreglass is still sometimes added in order to ensure it maintains its strength alongside supporting the spas water and bather load. When your bathroom space is limited, a corner tub can give you the most out of the space. The next big leap forward came when the Jacuzzi brothers hydrotherapy pump was combined with fibreglass bodywork, a filtration system and electric heating system to create what is essentially the modern day hot tub.</p>
<p>This spinning wheel has indentations that move water through the pump and create the pressure in the pipes needed to keep water circulating and moving through the spa plumbing. Swim spas have one amazing addition that traditional swimming pools lack—the hydrotherapeutic experience. You can program a customized swimming experience to suit individual preferences, monitor your progress, and swim whenever you like in the comfort of your own home.</p>
<p>In fact, most larger swim spas will even have a separate section that mimics a hot tub, offering a dual-purpose experience. Many agree that having a Jacuzzi walk-in tub has noticeably improved their quality of life. Their Simple hot tub Care®, system is an easy-to-follow program that is simple to use, but does for your hot tub exactly what needs to be done. Swim spas have it all—aquatic exercise, relaxation and fun for all ages from the comforts, privacy and convenience of home.</p>
