<p>The reason most people opt for a swim spa is that they don't have enough room for a full-sized swimming pool. The swimming part of a swim spa is what makes it uniquely different than a hot tub alone, however. Always make certain the spa's control system accommodates the heat pump. And if you're interested in swimming laps without installing a massive pool, swim spas are a great alternative. As we evaluated them, we considered their current systems and the types of jets they offer as well as their customer service, selection, prices and accessories.</p>
<p>Jacuzzi bathtubs are considered a luxury and not something found in the average home. So, let's take a look at what's so great about these two hot tub brands.

<p>When it comes to finding the best swim spa, you need to take the current into consideration. This means trying out the spa with water in it to see if the seats are comfortable, if the jets are to your liking and if the controls are easy to operate.
