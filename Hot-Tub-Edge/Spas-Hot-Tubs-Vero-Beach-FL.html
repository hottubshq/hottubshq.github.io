<p>The reason most people opt for a swim spa is that they don't have enough room for a full-sized swimming pool.

And if you're interested in swimming laps without installing a massive pool, swim spas are a great alternative. As we evaluated them, we considered their current systems and the types of jets they offer as well as their customer service, selection, prices and accessories.</p>

<p>When it comes to finding the best swim spa, you need to take the current into consideration.
