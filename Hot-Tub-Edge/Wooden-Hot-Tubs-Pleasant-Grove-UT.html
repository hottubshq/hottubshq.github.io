This cover includes an energy efficient 1.5 lb foam density and a 24 R-value, with a full length heat seal and upgraded rubber grip handles (included!). We had limited space and the swim spa allowed us to maximise the use of our garden and has proven to be far more economical than a pool.</p>

This system offers the ultimate level of insulation and is extensively used on Vortex Spas sold in regions with extreme climates such Scandinavia and Canada.</p>
