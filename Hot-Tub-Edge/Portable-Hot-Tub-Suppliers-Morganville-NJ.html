<p>That wonderful feeling you get whenever you sit back in a hot tub is because of the way your body reacts to the heat and jets of water. High-end swim spas are also generally larger than mid-range swim spas and include added hydrotherapy and fitness options that aren't found in other swim spas. The Jacuzzi Fast Drain technology drains the water in half the time it takes a standard tub to empty, which is a plus for your comfort while you wait to be able open the door. Come see our large selection of pre-owned hot tubs. Just think of it. Your whole body soaked in hot water, your back and legs and arms being gently massaged by sensual jets of water, with soothing bubbles all around, and feelings of peace and tranquility taking over your body as you close your eyes and start to dream and look back at the kind of day it's been.</p>
<p>The 150mm swim jets create a current strong enough to swim against. If you want a little more versatility from your hot tub then swim spas are also a popular choice for gardens. Hot tubs are also designed for more than one person, so soaking can be a great opportunity to spend some time with your partner or friends. Vortex Swim Spas are the perfect centre point of any party. The most common type of tub is the Jacuzzi drop in tub For installation, these tubs are simply lowered into a framed enclosure, and they also include Jacuzzi's largest variety of available sizes and shapes.</p>
<p>The Vortex control system will adapt and tune itself to the thermal properties of your spa pool and its environment, day to day, season to season, this will reduce 'on-demand heating'. As a fun way to unwind and relieve stress, hot tubs and home spas allow family members to have fun conversation while relaxing together. Sensing the American consumers interest in health, fitness and leisure activities, Roy invented and marketed the first self-contained, fully integrated whirlpool bath in 1968.</p>

<p>If you want to improve your fitness, relieve pressure on your body or melt away the stresses of daily life, an Endless Pools Swim Spa is the intelligent option. It is true that athletes can exercise, relieve muscle tension and improve their over all athletic performance through the use of a swimming pool and spa. Because of their flexible designs, modern hot tubs can be used in a multitude of settings. Many articles and clinics cover the intricacies of how this can be improved however; stroke rate or tempo is of equal importance for faster swimming.</p>
<p>Swim spas and spa pools (also known as portable spas or hot tubs) are very similar. We only needed ten shifts in the water (two of our teammates only had to swim once), which I thought was pretty impressive for a group of mostly-first timers. It was basic and even rudimentary, but from that moment on I have been obsessed with swim spas. The reason is air capacity is cut by approximately 75% during water exercise because of the water's pressure on your body.</p>
<p>Hot water is a great way to keep the body moving. A Jacuzzi soaking tub is the most common type of tub, and this basic concept is Jacuzzi's foundation for hydrotherapy tubs. Some hot tubs also come with features that Jacuzzi products do not, such as flat-screen TVs and built-in MP3 audio systems. Our Swim Spa River Jets are each powered solely by a 4 HP (6BHP) Hyper Flow Jet Pump. Having the swim spa completely above ground is another option that allows you to fence only the steps (as long as the swim spa is over 1200mm high the height of pool fencing).</p>
