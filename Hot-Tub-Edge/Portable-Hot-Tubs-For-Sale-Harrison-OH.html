<p>A guy named Dr. Stephen Blair (University of South Carolina) conducted an extended survey to study the effectiveness of swimming for fitness. All swim spa covers are made specifically to fit your Master Spas swim spa and come 6" thick in the middle and taper off to 4". This cover includes an energy efficient 1.5 lb foam density and a 24 R-value, with a full length heat seal and upgraded rubber grip handles (included!). We had limited space and the swim spa allowed us to maximise the use of our garden and has proven to be far more economical than a pool.</p>

He designed a portable pump that could be fitted inside a bathtub to give the hydro-therapy.</p>

Be sure when ordering an Aqua Flow Viton seal kit that it will match the pump used in your Cal Spa, Marquis, Clearwater, Coleman or other spa brand that from time to time has used Aqua Flo pumps in their spas.</p>

<p>A spa or hot tub should be shocked with the appropriate sanitizer after use. Hot tub water chemicals, especially chlorine have a specific formula that lasts in hot water won't turn the water cloudy and has the right pH for hot tubbing. When spas are created with less than 4 layers it will be made evident through the shorter warranties that accompany the spa pool as its lifespan will be dramatically shortened.</p>
<p>Indoor tubs may produce some moisture when in use, particularly if the ambient room temperature is much less than the water inside the vessel (hot tub water temperatures range from 100-104 degrees F). Those planning an indoor installation need to think about how long they'll use it and perhaps consider installing an exhaust fan to pull moisture from the room. The water inside a swim spa can provide a much more comfortable and enjoyable environment for low-impact exercise.</p>
<p>2nd Day Air Shipping not available for chemicals, spas, and other items that normally ship by freight. 1. choose pumps with single speed jet and circulation, 2. Always enquire about the noise of the pump, 3. Don't concern yourself with horsepower ratings, turn your attention to other more valuable components such as the spas jets or filtration systems.
