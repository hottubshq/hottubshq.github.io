<p>With the burgeoning interest in health and leisure across the United States, yet another opportunity was spotted in the 1960s, by Roy Jacuzzi, who invented and marketed the first self-contained, fully-integrated whirlpool bath, creating a whole new industry almost on his own. In short, hot tubs and Jacuzzis are not the same. Tests have proven that through having a heat pump within your spa pool or swim spa, running costs are reduced by over 50%, resulting in shortened and achievable payback period.</p>
<h3>Small 4 Person Hot Tub Thomaston CT 06787</h3>
<p>Many public pools require women and men with long hair to wear a swim cap while in the pool. Salt can clog the motor that powers air or water jets on other brands or rust out the pump or heater. Heat pumps provide only great benefits when added to your spa pool or swim spa. Take a look at all the wonderful videos on our video page to get a feel for all the different pools, spas and swim spas on the market today.</p>

They create more fun and enjoyable environment that you can continuously swim in. The interruption-free environment lets you really get into your zone where you can have fun with your workouts without all the worries that you might have in swimming pools.</p>
<p>Depending on the model that you choose you can have up to 3 River Jets powered by a total of 12 HP (18 BHP) on our Performance Plus Swim Spa Package. The Endless Pools® hydraulically powered underwater treadmill offers low-impact run or walk options. Swim spas are designed for exercise. If you plan to purchase an indoor hot tub, you should consider where you will install it and the people who will use it most often.</p>
<p>At that point in time, the Swim Spa did not really seem like such a great bargain. We have a large variety of hot tubs for sale. Some people prefer water temperatures to be at about body temperature of about 98.6. When someone who reacts badly to very hot water gets in a too hot spa they may have a heat stroke. You can find the same benefits of hot tubs in swim spas. Finding the best hot tubs for sale doesn't have to be difficult.</p>
