Today spas are frequently attached to hotels and sports complexes and come in a variety of different sizes and configurations. Draining & refilling of your spa or hot tub on a regular basis is the simplest, single best thing you can do to control odors.</p>

So, my best advice, is that one should only buy a product that is well built by an American or Western internationally recognized producer of Hot Tubs and then there is every chance that the product will last and last and give very many years of faultless performance.</p>
