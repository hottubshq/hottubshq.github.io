<p>A Swim Spa is both a swimming pool and a spa or hot tub. Jacuzzi hot tub brings the health benefits relieves sree, improve your sleep, soothes muscles & joints. Most swim spas can be properly adjusted to cater for every style of swimming technique. Since 1995, Nordic has led the industry in providing high quality, therapeutic hot tubs. From pure relaxation to therapeutic, Massage Therapy will help drain the tension from your body and the stress from your mind. There is ample space for your daily swim and workout, and water circulates with ease.</p>
<p>However, there are also disadvantages with such a design because the heat of the sun will be bearing down on you during the day and there is the increased possibility of dirt and debris blowing into the water of the tub. Some Sapphire spas have seats full of jets that we've positioned to target problem areas of the back, neck, and shoulders. They offer a powerful and steady current by using the paddle-wheel devices, jet propulsion, and water that has the speed of 2 and up to 8.5 mph.</p>
<p>Hot tub covers should always be on the Jacuzzi when not in use, keeping excess dirt and dust out of the water and jets, keep wandering children out of the water (many are lockable) and reducing heat loss to keep your bills as low as possible. Texas Hot Tub Company is the top choice to find quality Jacuzzi Spas in the DFW area. Use the word spa to describe going for a spa break” or if you are lucky enough to have, or know anyone that has a permanent, in the ground, hot tub.</p>

<p>By choosing a swim spa, you can swim without doing laps in a regular sized pool. Hot tubs can replace what used to happen nightly at the dinner table. The benefits of using jetted bathtubs should never be underestimated. Swim spas would waste a single penny of yours. Swim spas tend to have large seating areas, as they are primarily used for relaxation rather than swimming. This has added jets that release high pressure water, making you feel like you are swimming against the current.</p>
<p>Buying a used spa is another way of acquiring a hot tub without paying full price. If the swim spas are not cleaned or maintained from time to time, you will not enjoy the swimming experience due to the dirt collected and the bad odor emitted from the swim spa. One of the most overlooked areas in an all season pool is the ability of the unit to provide benefits outside the swim and massage. These are common pressure areas and jetted bathtubs know how to attack what ails you.</p>
<p>Depending on the model that you choose you can have up to 3 River Jets powered by a total of 12 HP (18 BHP) on our Performance Plus Swim Spa Package. The Endless Pools® hydraulically powered underwater treadmill offers low-impact run or walk options. Swim spas are designed for exercise. If you plan to purchase an indoor hot tub, you should consider where you will install it and the people who will use it most often.</p>
<p>Aside from the consideration of a spa's heat pump, the insulation within a spa pool determines how much output energy is required to maintain it. There are three main insulation systems used today, it is dependable on the company, manufacturer and model as to which one is adopted. The TruSwim® unique dual propulsion design guarantees an incomparable aquatic fitness experience with endless possibilities. We have been researching, ranking and reviewing swim spas for more than four years.</p>
