<p>A guy named Dr. Stephen Blair (University of South Carolina) conducted an extended survey to study the effectiveness of swimming for fitness. All swim spa covers are made specifically to fit your Master Spas swim spa and come 6" thick in the middle and taper off to 4". This cover includes an energy efficient 1.5 lb foam density and a 24 R-value, with a full length heat seal and upgraded rubber grip handles (included!).
