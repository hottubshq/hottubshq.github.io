<p>Did you know that a swimming pool is not only fun to swim and relax in? Aside from the consideration of a spa's heat pump, the insulation within a spa pool determines how much output energy is required to maintain it. There are three main insulation systems used today, it is dependable on the company, manufacturer and model as to which one is adopted.

A jet system creates a smooth current of water ideal for fitness activities, and massage jets offer relief from stress, aches, and muscle pain.</p>
