<p>If you are unfamiliar with a swim spa, then just the title is enough to make you wonder what it is and how it can benefit you. Some Endless Pools® Fitness Systems models also include an auxilliary control panel, located on the opposite side from the main panel for added convenience when controlling lighting and hydromassage jets.

<p>You can save up on your money and your time by avoiding the prep work that goes into creating enough space for a pool. They will even supply you with the highest quality of hot tub filters.

<p>This over-the-top hot tub gets better with luxury features like LED pop-up speakers for the built-in digital audio system, an aromatherapy canister for soothing scents and even a cascading waterfall. However, they are designed to be smaller than regular pools, as their primary function is relaxation, although the swim jets do enable you to swim effectively within the space. Sure it looks like fun seeing all of the foam that can result from hot water, jets and bubble bath, but it's a sorry mess to clean up. Typically it's best to drain the tub and start over with fresh water if bubble bath or high sudsing agents have been added to the hot tub either accidentally or as a prank.</p>
