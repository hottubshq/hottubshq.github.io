<p>Many people dream of installing a swimming pool in their backyards. Browse through the catalogs to find premium quality corner bathtubs, couple bathtubs, oval bathtubs, round series bathtubs, jacuzzis bathtubs, etc. Pay a little more and you'll get a better swimming experience, better components and lower running costs. You would usually work your entire backyard around a dedicated swimming pool area, but a swim spa will fit into a much smaller backyard or outdoor alfresco area.</p>
<p>Additionally, these swim spas are extremely relaxing and induce hydrotherapy with massaging jets and contour seating. If you want to heat your swim spa at all you need to consider buying a dual zone swim spa so you can use the electric heater(s) to affordably heat just the spa end only and take the edge off” the temperature in the swim end. This is due to the types of pumps, swim jets and plumbing used by many brands and the fact that they do not understand the technology involved.</p>
<p>Exercise pools are also known as swimming machines, swim systems or swim spas. Jacuzzi® Walk in Tubs are designed, engineered, and assembled right here in America.

<p>Sure, you eat right and exercise, but to really live well, you should add in a bit of hydrotherapy with a Healthy Living Hot Tub.
