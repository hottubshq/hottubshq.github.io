<p>I have been asked this question by so many customers. Therefore, to enjoy your jacuzzi tub safely without any fear of electrical hazards, you should hire the services of an experienced electrical contractor for installing a hot tub and circuit breaker. Keep in mind your intended use before you spend the money on a spa or hot tub. This is great news for Orange County swimmers and fitness enthusiasts who are seeking to get their swim on, in a strong current. To prevent hot tub rash, the CDC recommends showering with soap and cleaning your swimsuit after getting out of the water.</p>

The proper use of hot tub covers will prevent accidental drowning and even some accidents such as an animal leaping into the spa and not being able to get out. Pool chlorine is a calcium based formula; hot tub chlorine is a sodium based formula.

Sure it looks like fun seeing all of the foam that can result from hot water, jets and bubble bath, but it's a sorry mess to clean up. Typically it's best to drain the tub and start over with fresh water if bubble bath or high sudsing agents have been added to the hot tub either accidentally or as a prank.</p>
