<p>As inviting and innocuous-looking as your Jacuzzi or hot tub may seem, using it for therapeutic purposes will require more precaution than you probably expect. Your hot tub will have jets and blowers, which can be switch on or off, depending on how you feel. Just like our large range of spas , our selection of swim spa options spans all budgets and specifications. In the 1940s hot tubs began to appear in the USA, inspired by the Japanese ofuro Hydrotherapy pumps were introduced by Jacuzzi Fiberglass shell hot tubs appeared around 1970 and were soon superseded by cast acrylic shells.</p>
<p>In general, swim spas tend to cost more than hot tubs of comparable size, although that varies depending on such things as the number of jets and other amenities.

Single zone swim spas with 2 or 3 jet pumps require a 32 amp direct wired power supply (and isolation switch) and dual zone and professional swim spas require up to 60 amps (dual zone swim spas will supply two separate power supplies). A jet system creates a smooth current of water ideal for fitness activities, and massage jets offer relief from stress, aches, and muscle pain.</p>
