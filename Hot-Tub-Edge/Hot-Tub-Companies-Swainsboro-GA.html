<p>While it is rather unfortunate, from time to time your hot tub may have a leak in it. Thankfully, there are some easy methods that you can implement that allow you to locate the leak and have it fixed. If you've yet to explore the incredible benefits of swim spas, here's your chance. You may not think of a spa as life-changing, but Clarity Spas aren't just any hot tub. Thus, you can consider swimming at the beach instead of swimming in a swimming pool. 6. Number of jets versus number of pumps-Your average spa water pump should support a maximum of 30 jets. The setup is easy enough on this one, but heating the tub is slow going.</p>
<p>It can be difficult to carve out the time you need to focus on your fitness, health, and family.

Turn off the jets and slowly let the water drop in the tub. A perfect example of the confusion that exists: a hot tub, to me, is not a spa, and it's certainly not a Jacuzzi. Jacuzzi keeps things simple by only offering two walk-in tub lines: the Jacuzzi Walk-In Tub and the Finestra Bathtub.</p>
