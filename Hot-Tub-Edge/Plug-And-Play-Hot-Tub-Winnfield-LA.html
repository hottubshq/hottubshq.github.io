<p>Jacuzzi bathtubs are considered a luxury and not something found in the average home. So, let's take a look at what's so great about these two hot tub brands. Just like hot tub spas, most Swim Spas are molded out of acrylic and are typically 12' - 24' in length. It is also worth inquiring on what type of insulation they have as some cheap hot tub will have none, and therefore cost more to run but some other cheap hot tubs are well insulated and will be cheaper to run.</p>
