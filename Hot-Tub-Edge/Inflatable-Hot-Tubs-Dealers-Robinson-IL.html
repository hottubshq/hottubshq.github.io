<p>A guy named Dr. Stephen Blair (University of South Carolina) conducted an extended survey to study the effectiveness of swimming for fitness. All swim spa covers are made specifically to fit your Master Spas swim spa and come 6" thick in the middle and taper off to 4". This cover includes an energy efficient 1.5 lb foam density and a 24 R-value, with a full length heat seal and upgraded rubber grip handles (included!). We had limited space and the swim spa allowed us to maximise the use of our garden and has proven to be far more economical than a pool.</p>

Just imagine having a personal masseur at your beck and call each day, and you will know what you can expect from this bathtub style.</p>
<p>Jets are located around the sides of the tub and air injectors are located under the seats. For example, it's easy to see you need to buy a Synergy or a TruSwim swim spa if you want cascading water spouts, not a Vitality model.

<p>First of all, Jacuzzi bathtubs are extremely expensive, costing anywhere from $600 to over $15,000 depending on the features they offer. All brands will have different features and components to make them different from other hot tub brands. Hot tubs can be installed in two different ways, either freestanding or inground. Our wider safety access steps and flat stepping areas at both the jet and seating end of the swimspas is functional and astietically pleasing.</p>

The idea behind the Jacuzzi tub is to bring the great features of an outdoor hot tub inside. Jacuzzi® J-400 hot tubs come in a variety of configurations including smaller 2-3 person tubs and a large 8-9 person hot tub.</p>

<p>A spa or hot tub should be shocked with the appropriate sanitizer after use. Hot tub water chemicals, especially chlorine have a specific formula that lasts in hot water won't turn the water cloudy and has the right pH for hot tubbing. When spas are created with less than 4 layers it will be made evident through the shorter warranties that accompany the spa pool as its lifespan will be dramatically shortened.</p>
