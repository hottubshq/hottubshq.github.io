As swim spas are usually purchased by people with limited space, the average models are quite small compared to a full sized pool. Overall, considering the amount of features a swim spa has, it does offer good value, making it an attractive option, particularly if you are on a budget.

For all swim spas, be sure to maintain a chlorine level of about 1.0 - 2.0 ppm or if using bromine, 2.0 - 4.0 ppm.

<p>The deep penetrating moist heat relaxes the muscles and expands the blood vessels, creating a sedative effect on the nervous system.
