<p>Family owned Sacramento dealer offering affordable high quality Turbo Spas and Swim Spas. You are probably thinking, Yeah, this sounds great, but it probably costs like a trillion dollars.” That is a common misconception about Swim Spas…that they are only for the fabulously wealthy. Illumatherapy also offers four points of entry, with two on each side of the tub, and air bubbles spraying from the jets give the appearance of dancing as they reflect the light. The blowers make the hot tub feel like you've got your own personal geyser - forcing air from the bottom of the pool, and creating a very relaxing environment for you.</p>
<p>Experimental men have been known to get a bit aggressive with whirlpool jets, and some men have been caught with their delicate parts entrapped. As swim spas are relatively compact, they can be a good solution if you do not have a lot of space in your backyard. Recently our local factory warehouse ran a newspaper ad and featured a hot tub on sale for $750. Soak in the hot water and it will naturally pull out toxins and excess water from your body.</p>
<p>Reliable, high-performance hot tubs designed for comfort, efficient energy use, and simple maintenance. A common source of leaking from the hot tub pump would be the pump seals located around the impeller. But if you don't have such facilities at your place, you can book our cottage with a hot tub or jacuzzi that offer blissful bubbly relaxation. Visit a BioGuard Approved Retailer for free water testing and advice on how to take care of your pool, spa or swim spa.</p>
