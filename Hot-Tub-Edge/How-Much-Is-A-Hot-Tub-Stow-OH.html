<p>A Swim Spa is both a swimming pool and a spa or hot tub. Jacuzzi hot tub brings the health benefits relieves sree, improve your sleep, soothes muscles & joints. Most swim spas can be properly adjusted to cater for every style of swimming technique. Since 1995, Nordic has led the industry in providing high quality, therapeutic hot tubs. From pure relaxation to therapeutic, Massage Therapy will help drain the tension from your body and the stress from your mind. There is ample space for your daily swim and workout, and water circulates with ease.</p>
<p>And some hot tubs have too high a level of chemicals. Buoyancy-simulating Levitator Jets are angled upwards toward the swimmer to replicate the natural buoyancy that would be present as you swim in open water. The wooden tub looks a bit like an oversized wine barrel and needs a permanent platform to stand on. The wooden spa is heated by fire, is better outside and needs a fair bit of maintenance to keep it in good working order.</p>
<p>Some swim spas may cost more upfront, but you get higher quality workmanship that costs you less to operate and maintain. This is ideal if you want to enjoy the spa experience in the privacy of your own property, and can be particularly beneficial if you are recovering from a muscular injury. All of our Swim Spas come with installation and an 8 year limited warranty, leaving you to only worry about which model suits you best.</p>

We are involved in the business of offering high-quality range of Jacuzzi Pool. Most common reasons for buying one are for fitness, a pool for the family, relaxation, or year-round swimming capabilities. Even if you went for the most expensive swim spa that has all the accessories and all the features you desire, purchasing and installing it will still cost you much less than choosing a swimming pool and trying to install it.</p>
<p>If you want an inground swim spa installed, you can expect to pay more than these prices, as there is so much extra work involved in installing any pool inground. In many areas you can also commission hot tubs and install wooden swimming pools. Quarrycast is a mineral crystal composite, a new material developed by Victoria & Albert Baths, to enhance your bathing experience: it's warm to the touch, keeping the water in your hot tub hot for a long time; it has a naturally high gloss finish and it can be colored with the dye of your choice, maximizing the interior design options in your bathroom.</p>

<p>Endless Pools' swim spas range in size from 1,200 gallons up to 2,395 gallons.

The Exerswim Propulsion System is what makes the difference between the H2X and the other swim spas. If you choose a pool with a powerful water current, you can easily swim, exercise, get a full body workout, rehabilitate, relax, and still have plenty of fun.</p>
<p>Buying a used spa is another way of acquiring a hot tub without paying full price. If the swim spas are not cleaned or maintained from time to time, you will not enjoy the swimming experience due to the dirt collected and the bad odor emitted from the swim spa. One of the most overlooked areas in an all season pool is the ability of the unit to provide benefits outside the swim and massage. These are common pressure areas and jetted bathtubs know how to attack what ails you.</p>
<p>Multiple conditioning grills smooth and redirect the water, resulting in a swim current that is free of turbulence. Jacuzzi designed the CLEARRAY water purification system, which uses an exclusive ultraviolet light filter to remove bacteria from your spa water. A swim spa can combine all the wonderful, healthful properties of swimming that a lake, ocean, or pool can as well as those of a spa in which you can relieve yourself of the stresses of your day.</p>
<p>As swim spas are usually purchased by people with limited space, the average models are quite small compared to a full sized pool. Overall, considering the amount of features a swim spa has, it does offer good value, making it an attractive option, particularly if you are on a budget. Endless Pools is one of the first companies to develop this Swim Spa, or endless” swimming pool concept quite a number of years ago.</p>
