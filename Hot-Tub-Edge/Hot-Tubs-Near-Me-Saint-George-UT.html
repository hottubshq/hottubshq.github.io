We are offering Jacuzzi Whirlpool Bathtubto our client and our product is made of good quality. Another primary reason many homeowners are now opting for indoor hot tubs rather than outside is the weather. These X-Series models stand out from typical jetted options because the four swim jets are air-free and produce a no-turbulence current.

<p>As water flows through the pipes and plumbing towards the jets it can draw in air so as to make a water air mixture by an action which is known as venturi.

<p>Choose from a Whirlpool bath or Salon Spa for one of two bathers. 2. Fibre glass swimming pool for six people.
