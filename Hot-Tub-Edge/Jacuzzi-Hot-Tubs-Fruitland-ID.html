<p>Swim spas are equipped with a long and narrow tank, similar to that of a swimming pool, but on a smaller scale. More compact than standard above ground swimming pools, swimming against the swim spa's powerful counter-current jets will give even the strongest swimmer an excellent work-out. The understructure of a hot tub will determine how well it can support the weight of the water. While shopping for Jacuzzi tubs, you can do so on by popular collection.</p>

<p>During our research, we learn about swim spas made by well-known companies. If you're not working with a professional swimming pool cleaning services company, consult your owner's manuals for help with start-up procedures. Water maintenance is imperative when using hot tubs.
