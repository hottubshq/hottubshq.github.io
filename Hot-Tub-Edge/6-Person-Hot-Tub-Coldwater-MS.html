While technically Jacuzzi is a proper and brand name, when people use the word jacuzzi, they are referring to a standard hot tub.</p>

<p>Hot tubs and swim spas are both significant investments and both can benefit your physical and mental health as well as your social life.

<p>The drastic price difference while having the same benefits give swim spas an advantage over the other options. There are Hot tub on the marketplace now that are designed for two people only; therefore the tubs are much smaller to the traditional larger hot tubs.
