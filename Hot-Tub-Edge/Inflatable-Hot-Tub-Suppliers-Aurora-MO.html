<p>Jacuzzi warm water tub gives the enjoyment of a whirlpool. SWIM AND FITNESS SPAS. Jacuzzi tubs require care to keep that at their best, and that includes taking care of the water quality. Let's talk about Swim Spas!Our expert Swim Spa team can help you make the right choice. Hot tubs are really single-purpose. The best time to use a hot tub at a health club is in the morning, when, hopefully, it has just been cleaned and not many other people have been in it yet.</p>
<p>It's also possible that you might be wanting to build a permanent hydrotherapy pool maybe as an addition to your own pool in your garden in which case this would be referred to as a spa. Swim spas usually only have seating at one end with 2 or 4 powerful swim jets at the other. If you're thinking about investing in a swim spa, you're probably interested in its health and exercise benefits. The water is hot and the jets are powerful which I find amazing for a 110 V appliance.</p>
