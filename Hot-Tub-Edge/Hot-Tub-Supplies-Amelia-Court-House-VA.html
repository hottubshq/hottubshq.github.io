<p>When considering which model or Spa brand to buy the question has to be asked is it true that the number of Jets in a Hot Tub really matter or is it a question of how these Jets are designed to produce that ever so nice hydro massage effect that everybody enjoys so much. Traditionally the water in a hot tub is still, just like a swimming pool, and would only be circulated to heat filter it. Chlorine and disinfectants are used to maintain the hot tub. Pumps - Various pumps are used perhaps a separate circulation pump depending on the design of the Jacuzzi Hot Tub. To use vinegar to clean a hot tub, simply pour a one gallon jug of white vinegar into the tub and turn on the jets through one cycle.</p>

Typically it's best to drain the tub and start over with fresh water if bubble bath or high sudsing agents have been added to the hot tub either accidentally or as a prank.</p>
