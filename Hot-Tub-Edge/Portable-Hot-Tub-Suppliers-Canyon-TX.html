<p>The hot tub is an attractive and strong focal point when added as a new feature in a home. The Indulgence swim spa is the top of the line for us at Sunbelt Spas. Although ABS based acrylic has proven strength, fibreglass is still sometimes added in order to ensure it maintains its strength alongside supporting the spas water and bather load. When your bathroom space is limited, a corner tub can give you the most out of the space. The next big leap forward came when the Jacuzzi brothers hydrotherapy pump was combined with fibreglass bodywork, a filtration system and electric heating system to create what is essentially the modern day hot tub.</p>
<p>A hot tub used to be seen as a luxury item that people could only dream of owning one day. But endless swimming is just the beginning, because modern swim spas offer powerful hydro - massaging jets for complete rejuvenation and relaxation after a hard workout or anytime the mood strikes. Staying fit and living well is easy with the Vitality Series Fitness Spas, pleasing both your wellness goals and budget.</p>
<p>Some swim spas may cost more upfront, but you get higher quality workmanship that costs you less to operate and maintain. This is ideal if you want to enjoy the spa experience in the privacy of your own property, and can be particularly beneficial if you are recovering from a muscular injury. All of our Swim Spas come with installation and an 8 year limited warranty, leaving you to only worry about which model suits you best.</p>
