<p>These help to make your workout more intensive by offering more resistance in the water, so you are basically swimming the equivalent of a long distance within a relatively small space. At the same time, the price of swimming pools rose greatly as well….partially due to advances in technology and features, and partly due to the increased price of installation and insurance that pool builders had to pay.</p>
<p>For this reason, it is now mandatory on public swimming pools in many states in the US. However, a swim spa can be a great addition to your backyard, as it offers the dual benefits of swimming and the spa experience on your own property.

<p>Swimming pools used for competitions are usually found indoors and heated to allow usage anytime of the year and to more easily fulfill with the regulations regarding temperature, lighting, and equipment. Make sure when you drain and refill your tub that you use a true spa cleaning solution and let the jets run for 20-30 minutes, if not longer, before draining. Another little-publicized benefit is that swim spa workouts can help people improve their balance, according to another 2018 article by Rick McAvoy.</p>
