<p>Water remains calm in a swimming pool, which can encourage walking or standing over a more active swimming experience. Just outside the back door, you can have an amazing temperature controlled pool and hot tub in one - the perfect space for light aquatic exercise followed by rejuvenation and allover relaxation.
