<p>A lot of people ask what is the difference between a swim spa and a swimming pool? When you install your hot tub or pool you may or may not have used conduit or a duct that is buried in your garden for protecting the cables, if there is spare capacity, you can feed your power and cable leads through the duct to the location normally on a wall near the pool or hot tub. While some spas still use wooden tubs, there are many private spas that use specially designed hot tubs and whirlpools to create a relaxing atmosphere for their clients while still using the healing power of warm water.</p>

<p>Indoor hot tubs offer many conveniences that can't be found with outdoor tubs. If you are able to use a gas heater or heat pump (which offers savings of up to 75%). This bathtub exceeded my expectations.

<p>Indoor tubs may produce some moisture when in use, particularly if the ambient room temperature is much less than the water inside the vessel (hot tub water temperatures range from 100-104 degrees F). Those planning an indoor installation need to think about how long they'll use it and perhaps consider installing an exhaust fan to pull moisture from the room. The water inside a swim spa can provide a much more comfortable and enjoyable environment for low-impact exercise.</p>
<p>Swim spas and spa pools (also known as portable spas or hot tubs) are very similar. We only needed ten shifts in the water (two of our teammates only had to swim once), which I thought was pretty impressive for a group of mostly-first timers. It was basic and even rudimentary, but from that moment on I have been obsessed with swim spas. The reason is air capacity is cut by approximately 75% during water exercise because of the water's pressure on your body.</p>
