<p>OK, class ~ it's time to define the true meaning of the different types of hot water therapy. It has the new River Jet swim system with Viper pumps, and plenty of water features. Whisper-quiet motors, colorful lighting, dancing air bubbles, powerful jets — your bath is an expression of yourself and an extension of how you want to feel. Most indoor kinds hold one or two people simply because the available space is limited to the standard size bathroom. Similar to a regular bathtub you would see in a home, these hot tubs, sometimes called whirlpool baths or Jacuzzis, are filled with water for each use than drained when your soaking is complete.</p>
<p>One end of our swim spa features two ergonomic therapy seats designed to provide the ultimate massage experience while focusing on different muscle groups. Swim spas sometimes offer similar properties, but some seats may not have jets. The first to transform bathing into an experience, Jacuzzi® leads the industry with new product styles and innovative hydrotherapy. I had very limited space and so a swimming pool wasn't an option.</p>
<p>Deluxe 3-person hot tub with 40 hydrotherapy massage jets and a full body lounge. The Energy Efficient Collection The flat top rail minimalist design of the JLX® Collection not only looks good, but is engineered to exceed energy efficiency range features includes: Illuminated Advanced Control, Energy Efficient Performance, Patented Top Deck Design, Speciality RX Jets, Mood Lighting, Integrated Waterfall, Comfort Headrests and 4-Stage Filtration.</p>

Monterey Stove and Hot Tub is happy to be the Monterey Bay's trusted dealer of Marquis® spas and swim spas.</p>
<p>Approved safety locks - A quality approved locking cover is just as accepted as a fully fenced spa pool. Since every policy is a little different in their treatment of hot tubs, make sure you check with your insurance provider or read your policy to make sure you understand the specifics of your coverage. It might even be called a spa as in the Lay zee spa brand in the UK, but, if it's freestanding, semi-permanent and has inbuilt filtration and heating then it's a hot tub.</p>

<p>Lastly, Jacuzzi tubs are the perfect accessory to relax sore muscles and relieve joint pain. Currently, Jacuzzi is the world's most recognized whirl pool brand name.

The modular design also allows for pools of varying sizes from 7′ x 12′ to 10′ x 16′ with water depths up to 6′ deep. The idea behind the Jacuzzi tub is to bring the great features of an outdoor hot tub inside. Jacuzzi® J-400 hot tubs come in a variety of configurations including smaller 2-3 person tubs and a large 8-9 person hot tub.</p>

Best of all, it helps keep the Jacuzzi bathtub free of bacteria.</p>

It is a whole lot easier to climb into a hot tub than it is to pull yourself out over the slippery water filled sides so that cover will help prevent any sort of accident if you leave it open and unattended.</p>
