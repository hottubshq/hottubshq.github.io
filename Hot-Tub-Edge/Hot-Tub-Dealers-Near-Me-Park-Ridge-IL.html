Just like hot tub spas, most Swim Spas are molded out of acrylic and are typically 12' - 24' in length.

That's huge, and the implications of the study are equally enormous, which of course means that if you don't have, or have access to an exercise poor or swimming spa, then you should seriously consider it, if you're interested in optimal health.</p>
